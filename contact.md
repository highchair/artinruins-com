## We need your Help!

Let us know about current events. Have you seen construction fencing go up around a property? Have you witnessed a decaying property change suddenly? Let us know! 

Help us grow ArtInRuins and our collection of buildings. Contribute your expertise about a place, whether it be stories, history, or photos.

We have [a list of properties that need updated images](/property/list-by-newest-image/) as well. Tackle the ones towards the top of the list first so we don’t have any property still standing with images more than 10 years old. 

Have photos to contribute? <a href="mailto:info@artinruins.com?subject=Photo submission for ArtInRuins" title="Email is your photos!">Submit them with this link and the ability to add attachments</a> or include a link to another destination where we can download them. 


## Get in Touch

Need to contact someone without using our Anecdote form? Email [info@artinruins.com](mailto:info@artinruins.com) but be warned that we are not always good about returning email right away. 


## Attribution

Wondering if you can use our photos in a blog post or book or newspaper article of your own? Permission is usually granted on the following conditions: 

+ That the source is cited as “ArtInRuins.com”
+ That if the photo was taken by someone other than ArtInRuins, separate permission is sought

Please do [let us know](#get-in-touch) if you plan to use our photos and provide us with a link after the fact. 

**Caveats:** Photos from individual contributors might be hard to track down. Photos from the Providence Public Library are public domain and often our posts have linked to the source. Photos from the Pawtucket Library will need their own permission.

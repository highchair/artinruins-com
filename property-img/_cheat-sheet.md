## Project Road Map
* Add the ability to browse properties by Map
* Paginate category pages… alphabetical?
* Do something tag-like with the new "People" set of tags. These people pages deserve more of a description to deliver the biography and significance of a person


## Write somewhere about
* How we tend to romanticize the past, but we hope that AIR represents both the good and the bad
* We think about how more things were made in America but forget about the child labor, the long hours, and the environmental damage done to our own backyards
* We think about the value of hard work, the way in which mills were designed to be “cathedrals to work” and yet forget how the early work days were 10 or 12 hours long before unions fought for shorter days and higher pay
* We think about civic planning and infrastructure and the ways in which the car changed our streetscapes but forget how large projects like the highways disenfranchised mostly communities of color or lined the pockets of those who “knew a guy”


## Tools
* Providence historical aerials: https://pvdgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html


## Photo Template
* Bottom left corner: date of photo and photographer if someone other than me
* Bottom right corner, ArtInRuins text logo
* Either white or black is acceptable
* When using someone else's photo, add a credit but not a AIR logo

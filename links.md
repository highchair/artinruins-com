When ArtInRuins started there were not quite as many home-grown historians, internet sleuths, or blogs dedicated to tracking change in the architectural landscape as there are now. These are the ones that we know of and support, as well as links to some tools and resources that we find helpful when researching a property.

## Similar Projects (RI)

### Greater City Providence

+ **Web:** [GCpvd.org](//www.gcpvd.org){:target="_blank"}

GCPVD is a great resource for current news and proposals in pedestrian, streetscapes, and architecture that go in front of the City council or the Downcity Architectural Review board. Whenever I want to know “what are they building over there” GCPVD usually knows. 

### OldPVD

+ **Web:** [OldPVD](//oldpvd.com){:target="_blank"}
+ **Instagram:** [@OldPVD](//instagram.com/oldpvd){:target="_blank"}

Old PVD is run by historian Maureen Taylor. It is a map-based project with layers of historic maps overlaid on the current streetscape. Anyone can sign up to add pins to the maps. These pins might only appear for a few years if a building was built and then destroyed for one reason or another. The result is an interactive experience like walking through old versions of the same city you currently live in. 

### PPS Architecture Guide

+ **Web:** [guide.ppsri.org](//guide.ppsri.org){:target="_blank"}
+ **Instagram:** [@pvdpreservation](//instagram.com/pvdpreservation){:target="_blank"}

The [Providence Preservation Society](//pps.org){:target="_blank"} has been fighting irresponsible and disrespectful redevelopment projects in the City for over 60 years. In addition to helping to preserve the character of Providence’s built environment and championing respectful and thoughtful new development, the Society is a wealth of knowledge about the building stock we already have. Their architecture guide is a compendium of information from historic surveys, their Architecture Guidebook, and years and years of Ten Most Endangered Lists and Festival of Historic Houses programs. 

### ProvidenceArchitecture.org

+ **Web:** [brown.edu/cis/sta/dev/providence_architecture/index.html](//www.brown.edu/cis/sta/dev/providence_architecture/index.html){: target="blank" }

A teacher-led and student-built guide of Providence places, past and present. The information was collected in 2002 and 2003, so while it might be out of date now, it is a good source of data from that very busy time period before many buildings had been razed. 

### PVD Signs

+ **Web:** [pvdsigns.com](//pvdsigns.com){:target="_blank"}

A collection of mostly hand-painted professional, amateur, and decaying signs in and around Providence — including some neon or three-dimensional signs as well. A great visual pastiche of the typographic character of the city’s businesses. 

### Rhode Island Armories

+ **Web:** [rhodeislandarmories.org](//www.rhodeislandarmories.org){:target="_blank"}

A web compendium of ornate armories throughout the state.

### Small State Big History

+ **Web:** [smallstatebighistory.com](//smallstatebighistory.com){:target="_blank"}

The Online Review of Rhode Island History. Put together by some pretty serious academic folks, this blog intrigues me because they have been responding to recent events pretty quickly — the post on the Macaroni Riots and Vaccines in RI are particularly timely and intriguing. An easy site to get lost reading — short on visuals but long on quality historical content.

title: "Architect: Jose Rafael Moneo"
description: 'May 9, 1937 — Jose Rafael Moneo, and his namesake studio Rafael Moneo Arquitecto, is known for his highly contextual buildings which nonetheless remain committed to modernist stylings. His designs are regularly credited as achieving the elusive quality of "timelessness". He is the first ever Spanish architect to receive the international Pritzker Prize — architecture’s equivalent of a Nobel. <a href="//www.archdaily.com/tag/rafael-moneo">ArchDaily.com</a>'

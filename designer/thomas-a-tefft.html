title: "Architect: Thomas A. Tefft"
description: '1826 to 1859 — Born in rural Richmond, Rhode Island, as a young man, he began teaching in the District No. 5 School. The state school commissioner, Henry Barnard, noted Tefft’s talents for drawing and the arts and convinced him to move to Providence to study architecture. He started with Tallman & Bucklin and by 1846 he was doing most of the designing for the firm. After graduating from Brown University, Tefft opened his own office, and ran a practice for five years. In his short time as an architect, he worked on over 50 designs. Many are no longer standing. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Alexander_Tefft" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>'

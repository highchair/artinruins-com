description: 'June 3, 1818 to November 25, 1893 — Born in Boston in 1818, as a young architect Morse studied under Alexander Parris before going off to study in Europe. His first architectural commission was a church in Haverhill, the town that his family was from. Morse arrived in Providence in 1853. Initially, he was there to furnish designs for the house of a friend, Thomas A. Hoppin, at 383 Benefit Street. In 1855 he formed a partnership with Clifton A. Hall in Morse & Hall. Upon the death of <a href="/designer/thomas-a-tefft/">Thomas A. Tefft</a>, Morse became the city’s most sought-after architect.

title: "Landscape Architect: Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr"
description: '1870 to 1957 — Following in his father’s footsteps and namesake as the father of American landscape architecture, Olmsted Jr. gained national recognition by filling in for his father on the Park Improvement Commission for the District of Columbia beginning in 1901. Soon after his father’s death, Olmsted stopped using the suffix “Jr.” Works attributed to Frederick Law Olmsted after about 1896 are those of this son. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Law_Olmsted_Jr." target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>'

Hoppin to form <b>Hoppin, Read & Hoppin</b> until 1896. Hoppin then took Edward F. Ely into the firm, as <b>Hoppin & Ely</b>. In 1907, Ely left and Frederick E. Field became partner as <b>Hoppin & Field</b> until 1922. Thomas J. Hill Peirce joined the firm becoming <b>Hoppin, Field & Peirce</b> until Hoppin’s retirement. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hoppin" target="_blank">Source: Wikipedia</a>'

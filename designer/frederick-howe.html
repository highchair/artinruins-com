title: "Machinist & Engineer: Frederick Webster Howe"
description: '1822 to 1891 —  Howe and Richard Lawrence jointly developed numerous innovations for Robbins & Lawrence in Windsor, VT. He built milling machines and worked for the Simeon North company in Middletown, CT. While at the <a href="/property/ri-tool/">Providence Tool Company</a> perfecting the manufacture of the Springfield rifle, he interested Joseph R. Brown in machine tools. The first Brown & Sharpe machine was an improved version of a turret screw machine that Howe had designed. He inspired Brown to invent the universal milling machine and organized quantity production of Elias Howe’s sewing machines. Finally, he returned to Brown & Sharpe as President, machine tool and building designer, and chief stockholder. <a href="//americanprecision.org/category/exhibits_page/" target="_blank">AmericanPrecision.org</a>.'

title: "Architect: DBVW Architects"
description: 'Durkee, Brown, Viverios, and Werefels — now just DBVW — has been a major creative force in Providence since 1994. Historic and adaptive reuse put the firm on the map while new construction gave younger partners a chance to shine. The firm owns its own building in the Jewelry District and has worked with most of the major companies and Universities in the state.'

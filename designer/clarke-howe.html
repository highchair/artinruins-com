description: 'Established in 1893 as Clarke & Spaulding (Prescott O. Clarke and Arthur R. Spaulding), newcomer Wallis E. Howe was added as a partner in 1901. Clarke, Spaulding & Howe was short-lived, as Spaulding retired later that year. Clarke & Howe was dissolved when Clarke retired in 1928. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_%26_Howe" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.'

description: '1826 to 1913 â€” Born in Boston, Hall first appears to have worked with architect George M. Dexter. In 1855, he partnered with architect Alpheus C. Morse in the firm of Morse & Hall. The firm only lasted for a few months. He practiced alone until 1884, when he made Charles R. Makepeace partner, in the firm of Hall & Makepeace. He was highly regarded in his lifetime as an architect of churches, private residences, and mills. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_A._Hall" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.'

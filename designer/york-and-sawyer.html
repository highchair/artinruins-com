description: 'Partners Edward York (1863–1928) and Philip Sawyer (1868–1949) trained in the office of McKim, Mead & White (architects of the State House) in the 1890s. Their work was exemplary of a United States interpretation of Beaux-Arts architecture and their New York firm became well-known for the design of banks and hospitals. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_and_Sawyer" target="_blank">Source: Wikipedia</a>'

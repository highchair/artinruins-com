description: 'The firm name has changed as partners have changed and names have included: Cram and Wentworth; Cram Goodhue and Wentworth; Hoyle, Doran and Berry; and HDB/Cram and Ferguson. These are all successor firms to the original partnership of Ralph Adams Cram and Charles Francis Wentworth. Frank Ferguson, their structural engineer, was made a partner on Wentworthâ€™s death in 1905 making the firm one of the earliest Architectural/Engineering firms. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram_and_Ferguson_Architects" target="_blank">Source: Wikipedia</a>'

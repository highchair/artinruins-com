title: "Architect: Daniel F. Tully"
description: "An architect and engineer (with granted patents to his name), Daniel F. Tully Associates was a well-respected designer of athletic facilities for schools, colleges, and universities across the U.S. Many designs are recognizable due to their parabolic roof structures â€” triangles that dip and rise in undulating patterns. In 1984 Mr. Tully was selected by the Engineering News Record magazine as one of the ten best engineers in the world for his landmark work on the Brown University Olney Margolies Athletic building."

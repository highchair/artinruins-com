### About this Then & Now

In 1977, this view was captured for the National Register nomination form of the [Downtown Providence Historic District]({% link list/downtown-providence-national-historic-district.html %}). Meant to illustrate the outer bounds of the district as it turned from Downtown into the Jewelry District, the view looking west from Dyer Street captured that in-between space of industry on one side and retail and commerce on the other. 

Of note in the 1977 view (left to right): 

+ The family courthouse building wonâ€™t be constructed for another three years (1980) 
+ The parking structure for the Outlet Company is located in the center of the photo, demolished in 2011
+ The J. Hanley Building has not had its rooftop penthouse added
+ The steel-girdered parking garage has not been constructed

The parking areas that were parking areas are _still_ parking areas, though, which is a shame.

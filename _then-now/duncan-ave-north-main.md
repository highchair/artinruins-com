### About this Then & Now

In 1976, a photography student at RISD scouted interesting locations throughout the city. Quiet, perhaps forgotten corners during a difficult decade when the industrial nature of the city started to change. Manufacturing had been declining for years and the Renaissance of downtown was still a decade away. 

The building on the corner, now an Action Auto Parts, was auto-related in one of its earliest incarnations. This house in the upper right background was in wonderful shape in the 1976 photo, but looks abandoned in 2023, with junk around the property and visible through the windows. It is interesting to see the transition over an almost 50 year span but it is also plainly beautiful to see J. Boersma’s student photo at the time. The strong diagonal from the lower left, the way the colors are work together, and the quiet nature of it all. 


### History

Not much was found on these buildings, but the maps do tell a small story of how the area was built up.

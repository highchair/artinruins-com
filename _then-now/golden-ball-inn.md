### About this Then & Now

The **Golden Ball Inn** was built by Henry Rice in 1784, just one year after the end of the American Revolution. It was a distinguished place to stay, across the street from one of the seats of state government. The wooden structure eventually consumed the entire western side of the block between Meeting and South Court streets. It encompassed the George Earle building as well, built 1876, which still stands at the corner of Meeting Street. The building was razed soon after these photos were taken.

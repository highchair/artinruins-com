### About this Then & Now

The building was originally constructed for the **Solway Dyeing and Textile Company** between 1917 and 1923. It expanded to the north in the 1960s but its main buildings — the weave shed and the four story building to the north of it — have remained unchanged but for window openings being closed off with cinder block or glass blocks.

The **Slater Dye Works** and associated **Slater Screen Print** companies moved into the complex some time after 1962. We could find no city directories to pinpoint the date further. Our property page for [Slater Dye Works]({% link _property/slater-dye-works.md %}) has more details about what we could find in public sources.

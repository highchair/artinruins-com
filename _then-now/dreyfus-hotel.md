### About this Then & Now

Both photos are taken from across the street from the corner of Mathewson and Washington, looking at the western and northern façades of the building in a three-quarter angle. In the “then” photo, a few men are standing on the corner in three piece suits and bowler hats.

This turn-of-the-nineteenth century hotel turned student dormitory turned artist studios and living spaces was lovingly restored from 2005 to 2007. The circa 1900 photo is part of the Providence Public Library’s Digital Collection is uncredited and undated. The 2006 photo was shot by Scott Lapham for AS220.

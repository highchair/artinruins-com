## On The Boards

The City maintains [an ArcGIS map with projects under review](https://pvdgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ab28206d40a54791b7128555cd8e7e18) and completed that is worth checking out.


### 327 Elmwood Avenue

**Update April 2025**

</figure>

The site of long vacant land is proposed to become dozens of affordable housing units. Blueprints filed showed plans to redevelop 327 Elmwood Ave., once the site of a diner and then a gas station, into a five-story mixed-use building with commercial space on the first floor and 44 apartments.

The project’s developer, [Women’s Development Corporation](https://www.wdchoc.org/), told the City Plan Commission that units will be affordable for households earning 80 percent or less of the area median income. A rental home is considered affordable when total housing costs are no more than 30 percent of their annual income. That means these units will be designated to those who earn $66,650 in a single-family household, $76,200 in a two-family household, and $85,700 in a three-family household, according to new income limits released by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development earlier this month.

### Signature Residences at 209–217 Angell St

**Update March 2025**

  <figcaption>View from the corner of Brook and Angell, looking east up Angell Street towards Hope Street. Rendering by KITE Architects.</figcaption>
</figure>

A developer proposes 32-units of residential on the [site of three razed houses]({% link _property/209-211-217-angell-st-pvd.md%}). The increase in density of this neighborhood supports the low housing availability in the area [at the expense of the historic fabric of the previous neighborhood]({% link _essays/erosion-of-college-hill-historic-district.md %}). We lament the loss, but accept the change as a necessary one. At least the design if this building is an much-needed contrast to the [darkitecture across the street]({% link _property/116-waterman-st-pvd.md%}).

The will appear to be five stories tall but the ground floor will be structured parking. 32 three-bedroom units will be supported by 45 parking spaces, 42 of which will be structured parking under the first floor of the building. A number of zoning variances were requested for height, setback, and dimensions.

The City Plan Commission (<span class="abbr">CPC</span>) reasoned that the project met key requirements: The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the Zoning Ordinance (after adjustments or the granting of variances), there will be no significant environmental impacts from the proposed development, there are no physical restraints from the lot size or site configuration, and access to public rights of way will be maintained.

The <span class="abbr">CPC</span> granted approval subject to conditions to be met. The applicant included provisions to rent to non-students only. The project is intended to serve older residents. The <span class="abbr">CPC</span> stated in their approval the following constraints: 

+ In accordance with the applicant’s offer, rental of dwelling units to undergraduate college students shall be prohibited. Undergraduate college students may live in owner-occupied units.
+ In accordance with the applicant’s offer, rental to graduate students shall only be allowed on upon majority vote of the condominium

### 70 Houghton Street

**Update February 2025**

A new business park is proposed on City of Providence land on the border of North Providence off Veazie Street and Houghton. The land currently does not have any structures on it, and the proposal includes three large industrial warehouse buildings.

<figure class="u__img">

  <figcaption>Proposal for an industrial site near Whipple Pond, off Branch Avenue near the border of North Providence.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Providence Redevelopment Agency and College Hill Development LLC propose the project jointly in the neighborhood of Wanskuck. The 9 acre site (394,879 SF) would contain three buildings: Building 1 at 14,785 SF, Building 2 at 45,000 SF, and Building 3 at 16,200 SF. Buildings are designated as warehouses and as a contractor garage for equipment storage and access.

The preliminary master plan was approved with requests for a traffic study and additional details for the design of the main warehouse at the preliminary plan stage.

Developers Dustin Dezube and Kevin Diamond submitted updated architectural plans have been submitted to the City Plan Commission. [The Public’s Radio covers the story in this article](https://thepublicsradio.org/metro-desk/developer-updates-plans-for-269-wickenden/).

**Update October 2024**

No new construction progress has been made. Moved most of this information to a [#DemolitionAlert]({% link category/demolitionalert.html %}) post for [the properties at 249 through 265]({% link _property/249-265-wickenden-st.md %}).

  <figcaption>October rendering for Fox Point Capital LLC</figcaption>
</figure>

On Tuesday, October 17, the City Plan Commission approved an updated Master Plan proposal. This design has substantially changed; the facade has been broken up into three distinct sections and the residential-unit count increased from 62 to 75 while commercial and parking space decreased. The fifth story was hidden as requested by the Commission in order to grant the additional story, with a denied request to encroach on a 20-foot rear setback by 10 feet. The approval came with many conditions, including a request for further details on the transformer’s location; a recommendation that the loading space for parking remains; and requested specifications related to the cellar, landscaping, floor plans, drainage management and signage, all to be presented at the proposal’s next step, Preliminary Planning.

**Update August 22, 2023**

</figure>

The City Plan Commission approved the plan for this new building after the developer made slight modifications to the design. Even though most of the 60 citizens who packed the meeting opposed the development, the <span class="abbr">CPC</span> has a history of agreeing with developers who are making an investment in the city. They push back some, but not enough most of the time, and do not always consider public opinion. Granted, some of that opinion might be NIMBY, but many people presented salient points about the design, the increase in density, and the historic and relatively untouched nature of the neighborhood.

### As many as 326 units at 27 East River Street

  <figcaption>General location along East River Street of the vacant parcel (center)</figcaption>
</figure>

A vacant 88,000 sf parcel along the Seekonk River and East River Street has a proposal for a seven story, 326 unit apartment building with 163 parking spaces. The proposal won “by-right” approval from the City Plan Commission with some requested adjustments. “By-right” means the proposal meets all zoning and code enforcement policies and these projects do not require approval from the Providence City Council.

Councilman John Goncalves is holding a community meeting to solicit feedback on the proposal, and his recent newsletter informed constituents of the proposal. It included such details as:

+ **Project Overview:** The proposed $90 million+ development is a 7-story, 326-unit multifamily residential building with 163 internal parking spaces. The property is in the W-1 zoning district, which allows multifamily use by legal right. The project sought dimensional adjustments, including a height increase from the permitted 75 feet to 90 feet and a 50% reduction in required parking (from 326 to 163 spaces). These adjustments were granted by the CPC with specific conditions.
+ **Environmental Impact and Landscaping:** The development will include a 25-foot-wide landscape buffer at the rear, featuring a public walking/bike path and access to a kayak launch along the river. The applicant has also submitted a drainage plan for stormwater runoff, but the DPD advises that a sediment and erosion control plan should be provided before final approval.
+ **Traffic and Parking:** Ingress and egress will be provided via East River Street. The DPD highlighted the need for a traffic study to assess the impact on the street’s safety and flow, especially given the site’s location on a rising grade. The study should also assess the visibility and safety of the loading zone and the adequacy of the 163 proposed parking spaces, with a condition that additional parking spaces be identified off-site if necessary.
+ **Dimensional Adjustments:** The project sought and was granted dimensional adjustments by the CPC for both height and parking. These adjustments were approved by the CPC with conditions, including the requirement for a traffic study, CRMC input, additional community outreach, and the identification of off-site parking if necessary.

His newsletter goes on to say, and we largely agree and echo these statements:

> Given the housing crisis, there’s a diversity of opinions about these kinds of developments in our neighborhood. Some residents emphasize the need for more housing and welcome the increased density, while others raise concerns about the project’s height, parking, and impact on neighborhood character. Balancing these perspectives is essential as we move forward with addressing both immediate housing needs and long-term community goals.

### Large lot at 64 Angell Street to get Four More Homes

**Update**

The proposal was voted down and removed from consideration.

**Posted May 2024**

On Wednesday, May 15, the Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">HDC</span>) reviewed plans presented by the Providence Group (Dustin Dezube, Managing Partner) to subdivide an almost 30,000 sf lot at 64 Angell Street in five parcels. The historic [Captain George Benson House](https://guide.ppsri.org/property/captain-george-benson-house) (1794) occupies the center of the large lot and would remain in place, while four additional single family homes would be constructed at each corner.

The property is in the city’s College Hill Local Historic District and the federally designated College Hill National Register District. According to existing zoning law, the lot can be subdivided by right as long as each property is at least 5000 sf.

<span class="abbr">HDC</span> staff’s preliminary opinion states one house at the northwest corner would be appropriate, houses at the southwest and northeast corners would be possible, and a fourth house on the southeast corner is problematic. The meeting on May 15 heard an advisory opinion from the Providence Historic District Commission and public comment.

### 30-story tower proposed next to the Hilton Hotel

**Posted May 2024**

A proposed 216-unit, 30-story tower received an approval from the Downtown Design Review Committee in May. Only three members were present of the six, and the vote was 2-1. The project will not need to go before the committee again, as this approval cleared the way for final approval to rest with city officials.

The tower has been proposed by Procaccianti Companies who owns the [Hilton Hotel]({% link _property/holiday-inn-pvd.md %}) next door and built the [Residences tower]({% link _property/westin-tower.md %}) down the street next to the Omni hotel.

The building would be constructed over a parking garage with 248 spaces. There is an existing parking garage on site now and a one-story hotel addition housing a ballroom. The architect is [ZDS Architecture]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}). The building would feature “upscale units.”

Full story and renderings at the Providence Journal, “[This new condo high rise could go up in downtown Providence. Here’s everything to know.](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2024/05/15/new-high-rise-condo-building-could-go-up-on-atwells-avenue-in-providence/73684128007/)”

Interestingly, this proposal mirrors some of the same ideas for a massive tower project dubbed [The Power Block]({% link _property/power-block.md %}) that was never built on a lot next door.

### Proposed demolition of Mount Pleasant High School

**Update October 2024**

Plans for demolition have been scaled back and a hybrid approach now has the most support, where the facade remains and much of the rear of the building (the gym and auditorium) may be rebuilt.

**Update November 20, 2023**

The initial September 15 deadline for Mount Pleasant High School was only the first of three steps of the “[Necessity of School Construction](https://ride.ri.gov/funding-finance/school-building-authority/necessity-school-construction)” application process. The next steps are the Stage II application, due on February 15, 2024, and City Council approval, to occur in May 2024. Once these steps are complete, the plans will enter a Design Review process. While a full renovation is off the table, hybrid options are being considered. PPS will continue to advocate for a Mount Pleasant that retains its facade, as supported by many community members, students and faculty.

**Previous News**

The Providence Public School Department is considering whether to knock down Mount Pleasant High School in favor of constructing a cheaper alternative. The district has been under state control since 2019, and touched on three proposals for the school during a community hearing.

The first proposal recommends renovating the existing building, while the second suggests knocking it down and building a new one in its place. The final proposal is a combination of the first two, with a portion of the school being torn down to make room for a new build. Saving the building and upgrading it would create a $80 million budget shortfall, while new construction is more cost-effective.

The details of the proposals were scant, with no mention of the interior design or classroom models of each proposal. It was also unclear if the budgetary shortfall was created because of the costs associated with maintenance vs. the temporary savings of not having large maintenance projects associated with a new building for a few years.

A portion of this decision to demolish seems self-inflicted, in our opinion. RIDE and the school takeover administration cut repair funding from $26.5M to $3.6M which likely created a demolition by neglect scenario.

### Parcel 2

On Wednesday, May 17, Urbanica Inc. presented their [new concept proposal for Parcel 2](https://www.195district.com/projects/parcel-2/). This design now features two buildings, scaled at 3, 4, and 5 stories with the 3-story portions facing South Main Street and the height increasing towards the south and the waterfront. The Providence Preservation Society commends the collaboration with the State Historic Preservation Office and Urbanica to create a more balanced proposal for the parcel.

**Update October 2024**

The building this new development was supposed to demolish is still there and no progress has been made.

**Update December 8, 2022**
: [Added a page for the property in #DemolitionAlert and UsedToBeThere]({% link _property/230-waterman-st-pvd.md %}). 

**Update Nov 22, 2022**
: On November 15, the City Plan Commission unanimously approved the demolition of 230 Waterman Street, stating that there are no protections for this 1892 funeral home. [In response to PPS’ comments](https://ppsri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-11-14-230-Waterman-CPC-letter.pdf), the developer stated that “incorporation of the existing building would be impossible.” PPS was alone in opposing the demolition. The new building will host a ground-floor commercial unit and three floors with 12 residential units. We will continue to watch this developing project.

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: Myles Standish Associates on behalf of Capstone Properties is proposing the demolition of an existing 1892 building at 230 Waterman Street in Wayland Square ([Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/place/230+Waterman+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8286426,-71.388386,3a,75y,64.28h,88.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz3lPv_NCnYbzbhfnO3KScw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c1f544363:0x26886ae3553ca810!8m2!3d41.8288451!4d-71.3879823))— the former Monahan Drabble Sherman Funeral Home and location of McBride’s Pub.

: The [existing preliminary plans](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230Waterman-CPCMasterPlanPresentation.pdf) have been posted for public review. Outright demolition of the property seems unnecessary, and a more imaginative design could incorporate it. The current design is a bland and basic-looking four story condo that looks more like a cheap hotel. At least [77 South Angell Street (Google Streetview)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/77+S+Angell+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8294811,-71.3850204,3a,75y,244.06h,93.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stf3Mic6W7AKZcf5P0WQsWQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c7efaa567:0xe7a709966bd27b8a!8m2!3d41.8294102!4d-71.3856086), just outside Wayland Square, is a more interesting condo building with real brick and stone exterior finishes.

### No SMART Hotel but Demolition Anyway?

**Update January 2024**

The houses have been completely razed and are now an empty lot. We document the loss of [209, 211, and 217 Angell Street]({% link _property/209-211-217-angell-st-pvd.md %}).

**Update November 15, 2023**

While the proposal for a hotel on this site was turned down by the City Planning Commission, it seems the developer wants to raze the houses anyway. Councilman John Goncalves worked to issue a stop work notice, declaring that not enough notice was given. With no plans for a new building on this site, the Councilman argues that there was not enough time to review the demolition and its affect on the housing market (loss of apartments with no replacement). [Complete story at WJAR Channel 10](https://turnto10.com/news/local/providence-councilor-fights-to-save-historic-homes-from-demolition-rhode-island-southern-new-england-history-lot-land-november-13-2023)

**Update November 22, 2022**
: On November 16, the City Council heard SMART Princeton Hotel Group, LLC’s petition for a Zoning Change for the properties on 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential-Professional (RP) to a Commercial (C2) District. After initial comments, the Council determined they did not have jurisdiction and the matter was continued indefinitely. 

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: SMART Princeton Hotel Group and Angell Investments are petitioning for a Zone Change for 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential Professional (RP) District to a General Commercial (C2) District, which would allow a new hotel to be built at the site of three older homes. This petition was originally considered in 2019-2020 by the City Planning Commission.

: The [former plan from 2020](//www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20-010UDR-209-217AngellStreetMaster-Plan-SR-Plans-ExpertTestimony.pdf){:target="_blank"} has not changed and would require the demolition of three 3-story homes for a L-shaped, 6-story hotel with circular driveway on Angell Street. It seems as though the Mansard-roof design from November 2019 is still the design that [ZDS Architects]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}) and the developer are proposing.

: The proposed demolitions are for three houses, all listed in the College Hill Historic District ([a district that has undergone much erosion in the past ten years]({% link _property/thayer-street.md %})):

**Note:** Listing in a historic district DOES NOT offer ANY protection if the Council votes to approve based on the merit of the new design and the overall benefits to the neighborhood and city. It often only means that the loss of historic structures is a factor that needs to be weighed against the benefits of a new building.

### 122 Power Street

<figure class="u__img">

  <figcaption>Rendering by KITE Architects, dated September 2022</figcaption>
</figure>

During the planning process for the [Brook Street Residence Halls]({% link _property/brown-brook-st-residence-halls.md %}), one recommendation from the community was that Brown build a single-family residential house at the northeast corner of Brook and Power Streets. This is currently an unimproved gravel construction staging area and was previously a parking lot adjacent to a house Brown bought, 126 Power Street. In response to that feedback, Brown committed to the goals of a house that was appropriately situated on the corner, holds the residential edge where neighborhood and campus meet, and sustains the historical fabric of the street. Brown has hired Christine West of Kite Architects to design this proposed new house.

This proposed new house has received conceptual approval from the Providence Historic District Commission (PHDC) and is slated for consideration by the Providence Zoning Board in February. The City Planning Department has issued a recommendation against the zoning variances needed to build this house. If the Zoning Board denies the University’s requested relief, Brown cannot move forward on this project.

If approved by the City, Brown intends to sell this house to Brown faculty or staff as part of the Brown to Brown Home Ownership Program. To date, Brown has renovated and sold 21 Brown-owned houses to faculty and staff over the past fifteen years, putting millions of dollars of property back on the tax rolls. All of these properties are on College Hill, and allow faculty and staff housing close to campus.

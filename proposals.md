## On The Boards


### Large lot at 64 Angell Street to get Four More Homes

**Posted May 2024**

On Wednesday, May 15, the Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">HDC</span>) reviewed plans presented by the Providence Group (Dustin Dezube, Managing Partner) to subdivide an almost 30,000 sf lot at 64 Angell Street in five parcels. The historic [Captain George Benson House](https://guide.ppsri.org/property/captain-george-benson-house) (1794) occupies the center of the large lot and would remain in place, while four additional single family homes would be constructed at each corner.

The property is in the city’s College Hill Local Historic District and the federally designated College Hill National Register District. According to existing zoning law, the lot can be subdivided by right as long as each property is at least 5000 sf.

<span class="abbr">HDC</span> staff’s preliminary opinion states one house at the northwest corner would be appropriate, houses at the southwest and northeast corners would be possible, and a fourth house on the southeast corner is problematic. The meeting on May 15 heard an advisory opinion from the Providence Historic District Commission and public comment. 


### 30-story tower proposed next to the Hilton Hotel

**Posted May 2024**

A proposed 216-unit, 30-story tower received an approval from the Downtown Design Review Committee in May. Only three members were present of the six, and the vote was 2-1. The project will not need to go before the committee again, as this approval cleared the way for final approval to rest with city officials.

The tower has been proposed by Procaccianti Companies who owns the [Hilton Hotel]({% link _property/holiday-inn-pvd.md %}) next door and built the [Residences tower]({% link _property/westin-tower.md %}) down the street next to the Omni hotel.

The building would be constructed over a parking garage with 248 spaces. There is an existing parking garage on site now and a one-story hotel addition housing a ballroom. The architect is [ZDS Architecture]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}). The building would feature “upscale units.”

Full story and renderings at the Providence Journal, “[This new condo high rise could go up in downtown Providence. Here’s everything to know.](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2024/05/15/new-high-rise-condo-building-could-go-up-on-atwells-avenue-in-providence/73684128007/)”

Interestingly, this proposal mirrors some of the same ideas for a massive tower project dubbed [The Power Block]({% link _property/power-block.md %}) that was never built on a lot next door.


### No SMART Hotel but Demolition Anyway?

**Update January 2024**

The houses have been completely razed and are now an empty lot. We document the loss of [209, 211, and 217 Angell Street]({% link _property/209-211-217-angell-st-pvd.md %}).

**Update November 15, 2023**

While the proposal for a hotel on this site was turned down by the City Planning Commission, it seems the developer wants to raze the houses anyway. Councilman John Goncalves worked to issue a stop work notice, declaring that not enough notice was given. With no plans for a new building on this site, the Councilman argues that there was not enough time to review the demolition and its affect on the housing market (loss of apartments with no replacement).

**Update November 22, 2022**
: On November 16, the City Council heard SMART Princeton Hotel Group, LLC’s petition for a Zoning Change for the properties on 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential-Professional (RP) to a Commercial (C2) District. After initial comments, the Council determined they did not have jurisdiction and the matter was continued indefinitely. 

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: SMART Princeton Hotel Group and Angell Investments are petitioning for a Zone Change for 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential Professional (RP) District to a General Commercial (C2) District, which would allow a new hotel to be built at the site of three older homes. This petition was originally considered in 2019-2020 by the City Planning Commission.

: The [former plan from 2020](//www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20-010UDR-209-217AngellStreetMaster-Plan-SR-Plans-ExpertTestimony.pdf){:target="_blank"} has not changed and would require the demolition of three 3-story homes for a L-shaped, 6-story hotel with circular driveway on Angell Street. It seems as though the Mansard-roof design from November 2019 is still the design that [ZDS Architects]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}) and the developer are proposing.

: The proposed demolitions are for three houses, all listed in the College Hill Historic District ([a district that has undergone much erosion in the past ten years]({% link _property/thayer-street.md %})):

**Note:** Listing in a historic district DOES NOT offer ANY protection if the Council votes to approve based on the merit of the new design and the overall benefits to the neighborhood and city. It often only means that the loss of historic structures is a factor that needs to be weighed against the benefits of a new building.


### 251-269 Wickenden Street

Moved most of this information to a [#DemolitionAlert]({% link category/demolitionalert.html %}) post for [the properties at 249 through 265]({% link _property/249-265-wickenden-st.md %}).

**Update November 4, 2023**

</figure>

On Tuesday, October 17, the City Plan Commission approved an updated Master Plan proposal. This design has substantially changed; the facade has been broken up into three distinct sections and the residential-unit count increased from 62 to 75 while commercial and parking space decreased. The fifth story was hidden as requested by the Commission in order to grant the additional story, with a denied request to encroach on a 20-foot rear setback by 10 feet. The approval came with many conditions, including a request for further details on the transformer’s location; a recommendation that the loading space for parking remains; and requested specifications related to the cellar, landscaping, floor plans, drainage management and signage, all to be presented at the proposal’s next step, Preliminary Planning.

</figure>

The City Plan Commission approved the plan for this new building after the developer made slight modifications to the design. Even though most of the 60 citizens who packed the meeting opposed the development, the <span class="abbr">CPC</span> has a history of agreeing with developers who are making an investment in the city. They push back some, but not enough most of the time, and do not always consider public opinion. Granted, some of that opinion might be NIMBY, but many people presented salient points about the design, the increase in density, and the historic and relatively untouched nature of the neighborhood.


### Proposed demolition of Mount Pleasant High School

**Update November 20, 2023**

The initial September 15 deadline for Mount Pleasant High School was only the first of three steps of the “[Necessity of School Construction](https://ride.ri.gov/funding-finance/school-building-authority/necessity-school-construction)” application process. The next steps are the Stage II application, due on February 15, 2024, and City Council approval, to occur in May 2024. Once these steps are complete, the plans will enter a Design Review process. While a full renovation is off the table, hybrid options are being considered. PPS will continue to advocate for a Mount Pleasant that retains its facade, as supported by many community members, students and faculty.

**Previous News**

The Providence Public School Department is considering whether to knock down Mount Pleasant High School in favor of constructing a cheaper alternative. The district has been under state control since 2019, and touched on three proposals for the school during a community hearing.

The first proposal recommends renovating the existing building, while the second suggests knocking it down and building a new one in its place. The final proposal is a combination of the first two, with a portion of the school being torn down to make room for a new build. Saving the building and upgrading it would create a $80 million budget shortfall, while new construction is more cost-effective.

The details of the proposals were scant, with no mention of the interior design or classroom models of each proposal. It was also unclear if the budgetary shortfall was created because of the costs associated with maintenance vs. the temporary savings of not having large maintenance projects associated with a new building for a few years.

A portion of this decision to demolish seems self-inflicted, in our opinion. RIDE and the school takeover administration cut repair funding from $26.5M to $3.6M which likely created a demolition by neglect scenario.

### 108–110 Waterman Street

</figure>

**Update September 30, 2023**

We have added this property to our archive: [108–110 Waterman Street]({% link _property/rufus-waterman-house-pvd.md %})

**Update September 27, 2023**

Aa 5-story, 28-unit apartment building proposal received Master Plan Approval on September 19, with the condition of removing the rooftop deck due to noise concerns. It was determined by the Historic District Commission that the structure was not architecturally significant enough to prevent its demolition. Providence’s first National Register District, the College Hill Historic District, continues to be willingly degraded with losses like this.

**Previous Update**

The demolition of yet another contributing house to the College Hill Historic District is being proposed. The replacement is another bland dark box with 26 units and 56 bedrooms. The developer and architect are the same ones who demolished [two former homes on the corner of Brook and Waterman]({% link _property/382-brook-116-waterman.md %}). The architecture style would be the same as well, which would start to create a pattern along that street that would make it difficult to tell one building from another. Further, we think it would not be long for the one remaining house in between these two behemoths to be replaced by the same architecture. 

The design of the [new 26 unit building](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/23-030MA-108-110-Waterman-Street-master-plan-submission.pdf) can be downloaded as a PDF from the City website. We encourage citizens to speak out against this wall of sameness along an important commercial and historic corridor.

The existing building is the Rufus Waterman House, built 1877. It is a very handsome double-house with a Second Empire mansard roof, gothic details, and ground-cloor retail. Unlike some houses that have been torn down in the are recently, we don’t think you can claim that this house is “blighted.”

[According to the staff notes on the hearing, they are not opposed to demolition](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/22-030MA-108-110-Waterman-Street-master-plan-report.pdf) in this section of the city [as we have seen so many times in the past]({% link _essays/erosion-of-college-hill-historic-district.md %}).


### Parcel 2

On Wednesday, May 17, Urbanica Inc. presented their [new concept proposal for Parcel 2](https://www.195district.com/projects/parcel-2/). This design now features two buildings, scaled at 3, 4, and 5 stories with the 3-story portions facing South Main Street and the height increasing towards the south and the waterfront. The Providence Preservation Society commends the collaboration with the State Historic Preservation Office and Urbanica to create a more balanced proposal for the parcel.


### I-195 Land Parcels 14 and 15

Boston-based <a href="https://cvprop.com/">CV Properties</a> wants to develop an apartment building on the west side of the Providence River, north of the parcel that was recently in the news. My immediate reaction? I don’t hate it. The image featured here shows the first phase; below is an aerial image of the eventual master plan comprising three buildings. From the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/13/metro/proposed-project-i-195-land-could-include-housing-restaurant-lab-space/">Boston Globe</a>:

> CV Properties submitted their proposal to the 195 Redevelopment District Commission and company representatives will present their plans during a meeting on April 19. The proposal, which was shared with the Globe on Wednesday, includes plans for a 149-unit residential building to anchor <a href="https://www.195district.com/about/district-land/">Parcels 14 and 15</a> along Dyer Street. The proposal also outlines the firm’s plans for an adjacent parcel of land owned by Brown University.

The public is invited to comment at the next regular meeting of the <a href="https://www.195district.com/">I-195 Redevelopment District Commission</a> to be held in District Hall on Dyer Street. The public comment session follows opening remarks by Chairperson Crisafulli.

Members of the public should sign-up to speak during the general public comment session via email at questions@195district.com. Comments will be limited to 3 minutes per person.

### 122 Power Street

During the planning process for the [Brook Street Residence Halls]({% link _property/brown-brook-st-residence-halls.md %}), one recommendation from the community was that Brown build a single-family residential house at the northeast corner of Brook and Power Streets. This is currently an unimproved gravel construction staging area and was previously a parking lot adjacent to a house Brown bought, 126 Power Street. In response to that feedback, Brown committed to the goals of a house that was appropriately situated on the corner, holds the residential edge where neighborhood and campus meet, and sustains the historical fabric of the street. Brown has hired Christine West of Kite Architects to design this proposed new house.

This proposed new house has received conceptual approval from the Providence Historic District Commission (PHDC) and is slated for consideration by the Providence Zoning Board in February. The City Planning Department has issued a recommendation against the zoning variances needed to build this house. If the Zoning Board denies the University’s requested relief, Brown cannot move forward on this project.

If approved by the City, Brown intends to sell this house to Brown faculty or staff as part of the Brown to Brown Home Ownership Program. To date, Brown has renovated and sold 21 Brown-owned houses to faculty and staff over the past fifteen years, putting millions of dollars of property back on the tax rolls. All of these properties are on College Hill, and allow faculty and staff housing close to campus.

**Update Nov 12, 2022**

[A five-story, 41-unit apartment building will be coming to Providence’s West End](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2022/10/13/providence-approves-west-end-apartments-westminster-knight-street/10476194002/) reads the headline from the Providence Journal. This building is another design from [ZDS Architects]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}).

Construction is supposed to start in late 2022. The three lots of this location were the former [M.N. Cartier & Sons]({% link _property/m-n-cartier.md %}) and a car lot on the corner next door. [Older renderings are available](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19-051MA-311-Knight.pdf) as presented to the City Plan Commission in July of 2021.

**Update December 8, 2022**
: [Added a page for the property in #DemolitionAlert and UsedToBeThere]({% link _property/230-waterman-st-pvd.md %}). 

**Update Nov 22, 2022**
: On November 15, the City Plan Commission unanimously approved the demolition of 230 Waterman Street, stating that there are no protections for this 1892 funeral home. [In response to PPS’ comments](https://ppsri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-11-14-230-Waterman-CPC-letter.pdf), the developer stated that “incorporation of the existing building would be impossible.” PPS was alone in opposing the demolition. The new building will host a ground-floor commercial unit and three floors with 12 residential units. We will continue to watch this developing project.

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: Myles Standish Associates on behalf of Capstone Properties is proposing the demolition of an existing 1892 building at 230 Waterman Street in Wayland Square ([Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/place/230+Waterman+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8286426,-71.388386,3a,75y,64.28h,88.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz3lPv_NCnYbzbhfnO3KScw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c1f544363:0x26886ae3553ca810!8m2!3d41.8288451!4d-71.3879823))— the former Monahan Drabble Sherman Funeral Home and location of McBride’s Pub.

: The [existing preliminary plans](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230Waterman-CPCMasterPlanPresentation.pdf) have been posted for public review. Outright demolition of the property seems unnecessary, and a more imaginative design could incorporate it. The current design is a bland and basic-looking four story condo that looks more like a cheap hotel. At least [77 South Angell Street (Google Streetview)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/77+S+Angell+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8294811,-71.3850204,3a,75y,244.06h,93.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stf3Mic6W7AKZcf5P0WQsWQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c7efaa567:0xe7a709966bd27b8a!8m2!3d41.8294102!4d-71.3856086), just outside Wayland Square, is a more intersting condo building with real brick and stone exterior finishes.

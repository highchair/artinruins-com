During the planning process for the [Brook Street Residence Halls]({% link _property/brown-brook-st-residence-halls.md %}), [one recommendation from the community](//brookstreet.brown.edu/community-engagement){:target="_blank"} was that Brown build a single-family residential house at the northeast corner of Brook and Power Streets. This is currently an unimproved gravel construction staging area and was previously a parking lot adjacent to a house Brown bought, 126 Power Street. In response to that feedback, Brown committed to the goals of a house that was appropriately situated on the corner, holds the residential edge where neighborhood and campus meet, and sustains the historical fabric of the street. Brown has hired Christine West of Kite Architects to design this proposed new house. 

This proposed new house has received conceptual approval from the Providence Historic District Commission (PHDC) and is slated for consideration by the Providence Zoning Board in February. The City Planning Department has issued a recommendation against the zoning variances needed to build this house. If the Zoning Board denies the University’s requested relief, Brown cannot move forward on this project.

If approved by the City, Brown intends to sell this house to Brown faculty or staff as part of the Brown to Brown Home Ownership Program. To date, Brown has renovated and sold 21 Brown-owned houses to faculty and staff over the past fifteen years, putting millions of dollars of property back on the tax rolls. All of these properties are on College Hill, and allow faculty and staff housing close to campus.


### 116 Waterman Street

Walter Bronhard and Brook Holding LLC as applicants are proposing to demolish two existing buildings to construct a new mixed-use five story building with commercial use on the ground floor and 25 dwelling units. The applicant is seeking preliminary plan approval and requesting a dimensional adjustment to maintain a height of 58’ and five stories where 50’ and four stories are allowed by right in the zone. The applicant is also requesting a design waiver for locating residential development within 20’ of a main street – for action (AP 12 Lots 180 and 260, College Hill)

The two houses, Lot 260 and 180, are located at [116 Waterman Street](//www.google.com/maps/place/116+Waterman+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8276115,-71.3998322,19.89z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e44524ae26a263:0x9b511119671d3d1f!8m2!3d41.8275323!4d-71.3995313) and [382 Brook Street](//www.google.com/maps/place/382,+382+Brook+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8276115,-71.3998322,19.89z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e44524affe2a29:0xfe8b3be5684b211b!8m2!3d41.8277198!4d-71.3995312). Both are rental residential houses with construction dates of 1857 and 1895 respectively listed in the College Hill Historic district. This development would continue to erode the historic nature of the Brook Waterman Cushing Thayer blocks as discussed in more detail on our recent article concerning the demolition of [235 Meeting Street]({% link _property/235-meeting-st-pvd.md %}). 

A PDF document of the [proposed building plans can be found on the Providence RI website, linked here](//www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22-033MA-116-Waterman-St-Preliminary-submission-Narrative.pdf).


### SMART Hotel Proposal is back

**Update November 22, 2022**
: On November 16, the City Council heard SMART Princeton Hotel Group, LLC’s petition for a Zoning Change for the properties on 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential-Professional (RP) to a Commercial (C2) District. After initial comments, the Council determined they did not have jurisdiction and the matter was continued indefinitely. 

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: SMART Princeton Hotel Group and Angell Investments are petitioning for a Zone Change for 209-217 Angell Street from a Residential Professional (RP) District to a General Commercial (C2) District, which would allow a new hotel to be built at the site of three older homes. This petition was originally considered in 2019-2020 by the City Planning Commission.

: The [former plan from 2020](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20-010UDR-209-217AngellStreetMaster-Plan-SR-Plans-ExpertTestimony.pdf){:target="_blank"} has not changed and would require the demolition of three 3-story homes for a L-shaped, 6-story hotel with circular driveway on Angell Street. It seems as though the Mansard-roof design from November 2019 is still the design that [ZDS Architects]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}) and the developer are proposing.

: The proposed demolitions are for three houses, all listed in the College Hill Historic District ([a district that has undergone much erosion in the past ten years]({% link _property/thayer-street.md %})):

+ 209 Angell St. — House, 1857-75. Second Empire; 2-1/2 stories; mansard roof; siding; shallow L plan; side-hall entrance under Doric portico; bay window flanking entrance; gabled dormers retain detail; other detail stripped.
+ 211 Angell St. — **Bullock-Harris House**, c. 1850. Italianate; 2-1/2 stories; hip roof; clapboard; asymmetrical villa-type plan with projecting front wing flanking entrance porch with paired columns; quoin trim; single, paired, and triple windows with molded caps; deep bracketed eaves; prominent gabled dormers. One of the earliest and best designed villa type houses in Providence. Built for William P. Bullock, later owned by Sarah P. Harris and for many years by her descendants.
+ 217 Angell St. — House, 1892. Colonial Revival; 2-1/2 stories; massive end-gambrel roof; clapboard; fine large-scale, compact dwelling; off-center entrance covered by central porch with paired Tuscan columns; bay window over porch contains stucco relief panel with foliate ornament and date; entablature trim between floors and 1st-story corner pilasters; bracketed side overhangs over 1st story and end overhangs over 2nd; side bays and dormers; chimney projects through dormer on west.

**Note:** Listing in a historic district DOES NOT offer ANY protection if the Council votes to approve based on the merit of the new design and the overall benefits to the neighborhood and city. It often only means that the loss of historic structures is a factor that needs to be weighed against the benefits of a new building.


### I-195 Redevelopment District Commission

</figure>

On November 9, the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission approved concept plans for three projects: mixed-income housing on [Parcel 9](//www.195district.com/about/district-land/){:target="_blank"}, BankRI’s headquarters and commercial-residential space on [Parcels 8/8a](//www.195district.com/about/district-land/){:target="_blank"}, and a state health lab on [Parcel 25](//www.195district.com/about/district-land/){:target="_blank"}. They will move forward with some conditions to a one-part Final Plan Review. These projects will bring much-needed residential units, STEM jobs, and the first corporate headquarters built in Providence in three decades. You can [review the proposals on the Commission website](//www.195district.com/documents/) under “November 9, 2022.”


### 311 Knight Street

**Update Nov 12, 2022**

[A five-story, 41-unit apartment building will be coming to Providence’s West End](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2022/10/13/providence-approves-west-end-apartments-westminster-knight-street/10476194002/){:target="_blank"} reads the headline from the Providence Journal. This building is another design from [ZDS Architects]({% link designer/zds-architecture-interiors.html %}).

Construction is supposed to start in late 2022. The three lots of this location were the former [M.N. Cartier & Sons]({% link _property/m-n-cartier.md %}) and a car lot on the corner next door. [Older renderings are available](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19-051MA-311-Knight.pdf){:target="_blank"} as presented to the City Plan Commission in July of 2021.

</figure>

**Update December 8, 2022**
: [Added a page for the property in #DemolitionAlert and UsedToBeThere]({% link _property/230-waterman-st-pvd.md %}). 

**Update Nov 22, 2022**
: On November 15, the City Plan Commission unanimously approved the demolition of 230 Waterman Street, stating that there are no protections for this 1892 funeral home. [In response to PPS’ comments](//ppsri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-11-14-230-Waterman-CPC-letter.pdf){:target="_blank"}, the developer stated that “incorporation of the existing building would be impossible.” PPS was alone in opposing the demolition. The new building will host a ground-floor commercial unit and three floors with 12 residential units. We will continue to watch this developing project.

**Update Nov 12, 2022**
: Myles Standish Associates on behalf of Capstone Properties is proposing the demolition of an existing 1892 building at 230 Waterman Street in Wayland Square ([Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/place/230+Waterman+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8286426,-71.388386,3a,75y,64.28h,88.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz3lPv_NCnYbzbhfnO3KScw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c1f544363:0x26886ae3553ca810!8m2!3d41.8288451!4d-71.3879823){:target="_blank"})— the former Monahan Drabble Sherman Funeral Home and location of McBride’s Pub.

: The [existing preliminary plans](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230Waterman-CPCMasterPlanPresentation.pdf){:target="_blank"} have been posted for public review. Outright demolition of the property seems unneccesary, and a more imaginative design could incorporate it. The current design is a bland and basic-looking four story condo that looks more like a cheap hotel. At least [77 South Angell Street (Google Streetview)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/77+S+Angell+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.8294811,-71.3850204,3a,75y,244.06h,93.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stf3Mic6W7AKZcf5P0WQsWQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e4452c7efaa567:0xe7a709966bd27b8a!8m2!3d41.8294102!4d-71.3856086){:target="_blank"}, just outside Wayland Square, is a more intersting condo building with real brick and stone exterior finishes.

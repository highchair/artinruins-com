### Streetscape Survey

Before there was Google Streetview and the history they preserve with access to older street views, ArtInRuins had an idea of documenting streets this way. It was a lot of work, and therefore something we haven’t been good at keeping up with. Thankfully, though, the aforementioned Google allows older views of streetscapes (for now).

There is good reason why Benefit Street is also known as the “Mile of History.” Buildings along this stretch date from as early as 1763 (the old State House) with nothing newer than 1869 (the William G. Angell house). 

We documented the western side of Benefit Street, overlooking Smith Hill and the Capitol, back in 2004. (Unfortunately, the original photos can not be found, therefore we can not present larger versions of these photos.) Luckily, aside from house colors, not much has changed. These late 18th century buildings have been largely preserved and well-kept by their stewards. Many of them were designed by eminent architects at the time, as Benefit Street changed from its middle class roots as “Back Street” to a more affluent and prestigious street to build a house upon, with views over an expanding commercial district and downtown core.

#### Architecture

Since the buildings on this dense side of the street are so early in the development of Providence, they largely follow only a handful of styles that were prominent between 1760 and 1860. Later styles came into play less often as space permitted or as older homes were removed in favor of larger ones. The build dates and styles clump together in a way that shows how the architectural tastes changed over time. These are the identified examples of architectural styles in order of the first year they appeared:

+ 9 in the Colonial style from 1763, 1773-1790, 1786, 1783-1792, 1784, 1790, 1792, and 1795-98
+ 5 in the Federal style from 1795-98, 1798-1812, 1799, 1814-1818, and 1827
+ 6 in the Greek Revival style from 1828, 1833-35, 1837, 1842, 1843, and 1844
+ 7 in the Italianate style from 1835, 1854, 1857, 1863, 1863-1866, 1865, and 1867
+ 1 in the Victorian Gothic style from 1839
+ 1 in the Second Empire style from 1865
+ 1 in a pier & spandrel industrial style, the What Cheer Studio building at no. 160

Since Benefit Street homes were able to survive largely intact, the earlier Colonial style remains dominant on this portion of the street.

When it comes to architects of significance, there are not many noted on this side of the street. Many of the very early structures were likely designed by the builders and followed common patterns. A few notable names do come up, however. Russell Warren was responsible for the design of the [Benefit Street Arsenal](#photo-04), also known for collaborating on the design of [the Arcade]({% link _property/arcade.md %}). One of his collaborators, James Bucklin, was partially responsible for additions to the [Old State House](#photo-08). The clock tower addition was designed by Thomas Tefft. Three houses and the former [St. John’s Rectory](#photo-09) were designed by Alpheus Morse in the later Italianate style.


### History

Information about significant African-American history gathered by Bela Teixeira and Rosemary Santos. Teixeira was executive director of the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, and Santos was on the board of directors of the Heritage Harbor Museum.

#### The Old Arsenal

**The Providence Marine Corps of Artillery building, [176 Benefit St.](#photo-04)**

Built in 1840 by famed architect Russell Warren, the building looks unmistakably military with its turrets. The building was the site of an illegal meeting of the Ku Klux Klan on May 17, 1924. Usually associated with the South, the Klan was active in Rhode Island during the 1920s. It organized a meeting at the Arsenal that attracted some 200 men. The group had no permit to meet on state property and had obtained entrance to the Arsenal by claiming it would hold a religious meeting. Later, Rhode Island’s Gov. William S. Flynn denounced the Klan and forbade the group to use state property for meetings.

#### The Old State House

**[150 Benefit St.](#photo-08)**

Work began in 1760 and was largely completed by 1762, but funds for finishing the interior were appropriated as late as 1771. The building’s symmetrical composition and use of red brick with rusticated brownstone and painted wood trim reflect the late English Baroque architecture of the period of William and Mary and Queen Anne. It is now home to the [Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission](//preservation.ri.gov/). Here, at the time of the American Revolution in the late 1700s, there were intense debates between factions represented by Brown brothers John and Moses over the issue of slavery and a proposal by some slaveholders to free their slaves in order to let them serve as soldiers. Moses Brown, being a Quaker, was as opposed to slavery as John was in support of it.

#### Charles Shaw House

**[132 Benefit St.](#photo-12)**

In the 1920s, this circa 1850 house served as the Providence home of the [Prince Hall Masons]({% link _property/prince-hall-masonic.md %}). One of the country’s oldest Masons’ lodges, the all-black association was founded in 1797 by Prince Hall, a black Bostonian who had fought in the Revolution. Finding that blacks were not welcome in white Masons’ lodges, Hall started a lodge in Boston that sparked brother lodges in Providence and Newport.

#### Sullivan Dorr House

**109 Benefit St.** (Not included in our photos)

Built in 1810 for the prominent Dorr family, the Dorrs found themselves split politically during what later became known as the Dorr Rebellion of 1842, which challenged state government.

### Judge Staples House

**75 Benefit St.** (Not included in our photos)

Built around 1850. A small cemetery behind the house contains the graves of members of four black families who lived in the house from the 1930s to the 1950s. Across the street in the graveyard behind St. John’s Episcopal Cathedral is a slate tombstone from the 1700s memorializing “Three Respectable Black Persons, Phillis, Rose and Fannie Chace, Who Served in the Family of Sam’l Chace Esq.”

##### General History

The original town was laid out along the eastern shore of the Providence and Moshassuck rivers. Following an Indian path, the Town Street (now North and South Main Streets) served as the main community axis. Fifty-two long, narrow house lots, fronting on the mile-long Town Street, extended east over the hill to Ferry Road, known as Hope Street since 1807. Commercial and residential structures were mixed along the Town Street, with the lands to the east used for agriculture and the waterfront used for commerce. Built upon for the longest period of time, this area is now characterized by a mix of structures dating, from the early eighteenth century to the present. […]

A new neighborhood was created in 1756 when Benefit Street was laid out midway up the hill paralleling the Town Street. It was the first highway to disrupt the pattern of the original proprietors’ lots. Known at first as the Back Street, this area has the best remaining concentration of historic residential architecture in the city. Containing primarily houses from the end of the eighteenth through the end of the nineteenth centuries, the street boasts several structures of national significance. […]

The social history of College Hill can be followed in the develop­ment of its several neighborhoods. The first of these, chiefly along Main and Benefit Streets, is the original compact part of Providence where public and commercial building has been concentrated near the waterfront and where the eighteenth and early nineteenth-century residential area survives almost intact. […]

In literature, Edgar Alien Poe worked for a while in Providence, where, in the Athenaeum, he wooed and lost the Providence poetess Sarah Helen Whitman (whose house stands at [88 Benefit Street](#photo-22)). The poems “To Helen” and “Annabelle Lee” are supposed to have been written for Sarah Whitman. Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937), the author of numerous Gothic horror tales, was a lifetime resident on College Hill, and his works abound with local references.

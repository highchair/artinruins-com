The front is four bays across while the building has much more depth to it and is partially one story on the rear level. Subtle brick details adorn the facade, but one has to look for them. The building seems very plain at a quick glance.'

### Current Tenants/Owners

As long as we have lived in Providence (27 years as of 2026), this building has been **Atlas Vending** It is interesting to read in the history below they the business was once **Atlas Music Garage** because we always thought the previous window treatment on the façade created the impression of piano keys.

Apparently, even “Atlas Music” was in the vending machine business. A Journal story from 1996 quotes a manager in a story about cigarette machines and a new law that required they have child-proof locks:

> At Atlas Music Corporation in Providence, cigarette manager Louis Parrillo said about 80 percent of his machines have been equipped with locking units. "Our number-one priority is places where children can go in, such as a restaurant," he said.[^1]

[^1]: EMERY JR., C. EUGENE. “Many cigarette machines lack required ‘child-proof’ lock systems.” <em>Providence Journal (RI)</em>, ALL ed., sec. NEWS, 4 Jan. 1996, pp. A-01. <em>NewsBank: America’s News – Historical and Current</em>, https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=D4BD6B42F1AB4706B5E1244D477DEE03&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews/1525219104245938. Accessed 22 Jan. 2026.

According to Atlas Vending’s annual report filing they “PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THE SALE, LEASING AND OPERATION OF COIN VENDING MACHINES.” Their annual reports are up to date, with a short form submitted in 2025.

It seems very quiet over there. They have always been there and perhaps will continue to be, but there is never much activity in and around the place — not like we are stalking them and watching every move.

The building has had a recent paint job in stark white except for the front facade, much like its neighbor at 1100 North Main, the former [Benny’s Automotive]({% link _property/bennys-auto-pvd.md %}). We could find no connection, however, to Thomas Badway and Christopher Maselli, who have recently been acquiring real estate along North Main Street.

### History

_From the PPS/RIHPHC Providence Architecture Guide, 2003, by Wm. MacKenzie Woodward_

An altered two-story, brick-faced, concrete block building with four projecting brick piers articulating each bay on the façade. Geometric detailing in the form of rectangular cartouches and lozenges in concrete embellish the building’s facade. These decorations give the building a slight hint of Art Deco styling. Side elevations are covered in vinyl siding at the second story level. The building’s primary entrance is offset on the façade and features a replacement metal-and-glass door. Large window openings on the first floor of the façade have been filled in, leaving only narrow, vertical fixed windows ([see 2002 photo](#photo-atlas-vending-jh-2002-06-01)). Remaining fenestration includes single, 1/1 sash and fixed sash on the north elevation. Windows on the south elevation have been bricked in. A one-story, flat-roof, concrete block addition projects from the rear of the building.

Like the structure at 851 North Main Street, this building appears to have been built as a garage and first appears on the 1926 Sanborn map as an auditorium/garage owned by Frederick J. Shanley. The 1937 map identifies the structure as the **Atlas Music Garage**. In 1950, it was home to **Standard Rim and Wheel of Rhode Island**. The 1955 map identifies the building as **Auto Wheels Sales and Service**. It presently houses **Atlas Vending**.

#### Maps

Unlike the 2003 history, we found a 1921–1951 Sanborn Map to show “Armory Garage” at this location, capacity of 30 cars.[^2] The number 1106 address has not changed since then. The 1955 map corroborates the history above, with a label of “Auto Wheels Sales & Service.”[^3] The color of the building changes, though, indicating either a correction or a change in the construction materials.

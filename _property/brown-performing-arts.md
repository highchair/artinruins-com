### Proposal

The 118,000-square-foot structure opened in October 2023 includes a main musical performance hall, practice rooms, and rehearsal areas. Designed by [architectural firm REX](//rex-ny.com/project/lindemann-brown/) with structural engineering by Odeh Engineers, the structure features many modern and unique approaches.[^1]

[^1] “THE LINDEMANN PERFORMING ARTS CENTER AT BROWN UNIVERSITY.” REX Architecture. Accessed 06 September 2024 from https://rex-ny.com/project/lindemann-brown/

The main performance hall uses mechanized systems to transform the space into five completely different stage and audience configurations. The flexibility of the space allows it to transform from large concert hall to more intimate performance spaces — a 625-seat symphony orchestra hall; a 325-seat proscenium theater; a 450-seat recital hall; a column-free, flat-floor configuration; and an experimental media cube.[^2]

To bring the outside in, and to allow those outside to see the activity inside, a belt of windows protrude from the main structure at ground level. Since the building is built upon an incline, the lobby is at ground level on the west side and a story above ground level on the east side. Impressively, the engineers devised a long span steel belt truss system supported only at the four corners of the building, which makes the lobby appear as if it is floating, cantilevered away from the main white box.[^3]

While the white box seems huge compared to the human-scale housing on two sides, it actually puts more space underground in order to meet the height restrictions enforced by zoning. A deep basement contains space for practice rooms, classrooms, offices, and dance studios. Further, the configurable main hall above grade is acoustically isolated from the spaces in the basement, allowing multiple performances to happen at the same time.[^4]

### Design Reception

Architecture critic William Morgan panned the building’s design as a “Giant White Shoe Box” in February of 2022. He called it “an alien intruder in the tightly-packed College Hill townscape.” He goes on to quote a College Hill neighbor as calling “the arts center an ‘abomination,’ and notes that ‘it represents all that has become wrong with Brown.‘” He goes on to say that “Brown has little interest in respecting and protecting its College Hill habitat if it interferes with its expansion.“[^5]”

While on some level we can agree when we look at Brown’s architectural investments more broadly, we actually think this is a stand-out building that provides much contrast to the sameness of College Hill and all the Ivy League of “The Walk” between the main green and the north side of campus. Facing the equally odd Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, these two very different but very modern buildings show how college campuses can look towards the future. These buildings might be the grand dames of campus 50 years from now. They certainly take more of a chance and make more of a statement than the [recent student wellness center]({% link _property/wellness-center-residence-hall.md %}) and the new [dorms on Brook Street]({% link _property/brown-brook-st-residence-halls.md %}).

While Mr. Morgan does not like the “ribbon wall” of the glass cantilevered lobby area, we think the effect works well. The light and transparency of this glass section makes the white box look light and airy, like it is floating, instead of what it could have been — a big, dumb, solid but empty-looking shoe box. On this, we disagree with Mr. Morgan. We both agree that the aluminum fluting resembles a large carved marble column and the way it casts thin shadows is quite effective at making the boxiness of it interesting to look at.

The main point that Mr. Morgan potentially gets right involves all the tech involved in the building. The fancy moving walls and seating areas that transform the space into five different configurations is impressive. But technology keeps getting better. What is the shelf life for all these moving parts, and will the University continue to spend the money required to maintain good working order?

Do the students who pay upwards of $65,000 a year deserve a state-of-the-art, envy-of-others performance space? Sure, they do. Did Brown change its plans when neighbors and preservationists pushed back on their original proposal? Yes, they did (see [In the News](#in-the-news)). Did they invest in moving a large, 1868-built house? Definitely. Did they also take a wild swing at moving our perception of what can be relevant and interesting within the context of a largely Victorian-era, Eurocentric campus? Absolutely.

#### Brown ends plan to demolish 4 houses - Pressed by neighbors, preservationists, university shifts location of proposed performing arts center

_by Christine Dunn_  
**Providence Journal** | February 21, 2018 (abridged)

Facing resistance from preservationists, Brown University said it will revise its plan for a new performing-arts center to avoid the demolition of four historical houses on College Hill.

The revised plan reduces the “above-ground footprint” of the proposed building, the university said in a news release Tuesday, and “shifts the building north to a smaller plot on The Walk between Angell and Olive streets, facing the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts.”

Shifting the location “will require the relocation of only a single structure (Sharpe House on Angell Street) and no proposed demolitions,” the Brown announcement added. “And because there is no bus tunnel beneath the smaller site, more of the programming space can be moved underground.” […]

“I think it’s admirable that they are responding to community concerns,” said Brent Runyon, executive director of the Providence Preservation Society. Runyon added that the preservation society is meeting with representatives of Brown on Thursday to discuss the new plan, and he wished to reserve further comment until after that meeting.

Brown’s original plan placed the facility between Angell and Waterman streets on the west side of The Walk. The site included six structures; four would have been demolished, one would have been moved, and one would have remained.

Five of the buildings were included on the Providence Preservation Society’s [Most Endangered Properties List for 2018](/pps-ten-most/#2018): the Leonard M. Blodgett House, 127 Angell St. (1853); the Edward J. Cushing House, 129 Angell St. (c. 1849); the Lucien Sharpe Carriage House, 135 Angell St. (1885); Norwood House (aka Benjamin Stevens House), 82 Waterman St. (1857); and 86 Waterman St. (1857-1875). […]

Shifting the site will require the [relocation of the 1873 Sharpe House](//www.brown.edu/news/2020-02-05/history), home to the Department of History. Carey said Brown is developing a plan to relocate it next to the Peter Green House on Brown Street.

With the addition of the performing-arts center and the relocation of Sharpe House, a portion of Olive Street between Thayer and Brown streets that is owned by the university will likely be closed to regular vehicle traffic, Carey said. […]

Brown said it owns more than 130 historical houses and buildings, and [university architect Collette] Creppell said the university has invested “more than $500 million in the preservation of these buildings in the last 12 years alone.”

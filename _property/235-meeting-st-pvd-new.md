### Proposal

A Thayer Street District Management Authority meeting heard details about the plan to replace [235 Meeting Street]({% link _property/235-meeting-st-pvd.md %}) in their November 2020 meeting. The developer Paul Boutros planned to construct 4-story building with commercial space for a restaurant on the first and second floors with the third and fourth floors containing four apartments each. <abbr title="Providence Preservation Society">PPS</abbr> objected to a few of the design details and the architect went back and forth on a few plans. The original date of construction was Fall of 2021 but the building did not come down until August 2022.[^1]

### Design Reception

There hasn’t been much said yet and the construction is not complete. We have not been able to find an architectural rendering of the proposed building. Like most, we’ll just have to wait and see.

### Reason for Demolition

We happened across a this church while researching the property next door at [189 Broadway]({% link _property/189-broadway.md %}). We saw it on the maps from 1951 and were intrigued. Luckily, there were two photos we could find in the collection of the Providence Public Library.

The design is a symmetrical, wood-frame, gable roof plan with two towers on either side of a central entrance. Windows are small but most feature round tops. Above the central entrance are two pairs of round top windows, grouped by an additional round top — four narrow windows present as a pair of two. These windows contain stained glass designs. Each tower features a single pair in a similar design. The interior space had a 31 foot ceiling height, likely to the apex of the gable roof. The building was built out to the edges of the small lot.

The earliest map we have access to shows the church at this location in 1875. It is listed as the **Fourth M.E. Church** (Methodist) in the 1875 and 1882 maps. The earliest mention of the church is related to Carlos Banning and Richard Donkersly who are listed as pastors at “[Providence, Broadway Methodist Church](https://www.ourfamtree.org/records/ministers.php/RI/Providence-Co/Providence%2C-Broadway-Methodist-Church)” in 1850. The source file found at this site gives a lengthy history of the church from 1850 to 1897.

The history details a former church or house at the corner of “Fountain and Franklin” streets, which is likely what is now West Fountain and West Frankin, where the Public Safety Complex is. The story uses the phase “remove the church building to it,” suggesting this church building was moved a number of blocks. A map previous to its move in 1860 showing a similar church building at Fountain and Franklin has not been found to verify this. [In 1875, the corner of Fountain and Franklin is captured in this map](https://t93c12bb2a2098924.starter1ua.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_09125377-f315-4b80-9276-cd39d5ec2fe8/).


### Current Events

The lot has been vacant and used for parking since the demolition in 1969.


### History

#### Broadway M.E. (Methodist Episcopal) Church

_From “Souvenir History of the New England Southern Conference,” published 1897, page 150_

In the month of April, 1850, under the direction of members of the Chestnut Street Church, a Sunday school was organized for the benefit of the Methodist people in the northwest part of the city. The meeting place was in an old Calvinistic Baptist church located at the corner of Dean and Federal streets. In the same building on the same Sabbath Rev. T. G. Carver preached. Thus began what is now the Broadway church. The pastors of the Chestnut, Power and Mathewson Streets gave their services on Sabbath evenings until the prosperity of the new society warranted the securing of a regular pastor. A superannuated member of the conference; Rev. Richard Donkersley, was secured and served the society for a time. In the autumn of this year Rev. Carlos Banning took charge, and inaugurated regular Sabbath services. Prosperity attended the work for three years, when it became evident that a new location must be secured in order to give proper opportunity for the further growth of the society.

At a meeting of the official board on May 20, 1854, a committee to secure a house for worship in another and more suitable locality was appointed. At the corner of Fountain and Franklin streets stood a church of the Wesleyan Methodists. The society organized in 1840 had failed to succeed and their house was unoccupied. The committee secured this house with the privilege of purchasing. The official board confirmed the action of the committee and voted to move to the new location at once. On Sunday, April 22, 1855, the first service was held in this church, Rev. Jonathan Cady, the pastor, preaching.

Passing over the years from 1855 to 1859, we find the same difficulty again facing this society. After much planning and discussion it was finally decided to purchase an eligible lot on Broadway, remove the church building to it and sell the lot on Fountain street. The work of removal and making extensive modifications was made possible by the enthusiasm of the pastor, Rev. E. B. Bradford. “He not only preached, but performed manual labor on the church from first to last.” The dedication of this church, September, 1860, marked its highest prosperity hitherto. Though many difficulties have met this society, yet the record from 1860 onward has been one of which Methodism need not be ashamed. The society has grown. Many faithful Christians mark this church as “the spot on earth most clear.” The building has been repaired and improved to suit the needs of the congregation. The movement was first called Federal Street Mission. In 1855 the name was changed to Fourth Methodist Episcopal church. When the last location was secured the name became Broadway.

We have not found a source that explains the changes to the congregation after 1897, nor why the building was demolished.

We place its demolition in 1969 using only Polk’s Providence City Directories. [A 1968 directory](https://archive.org/details/polksprovidencepunse_3/page/n1355/mode/2up?q=%22Broadway+Italian%22) lists on Broadway “197 Broadway Methodist Church.” [In the 1970 directory, however,](https://archive.org/details/polksprovidencep00unse_1/page/n1017/mode/2up) number 197 is listed as “Vacant.” It remains listed as vacant in the 1972 directory as well and is not listed as an address at all by the 1976 directory.

We decided to call this property by its most recent name since it is already so old and far removed from the present. If anyone remembers it, they likely remember it as the **Broadway Italian Methodist Episcopal Church**.

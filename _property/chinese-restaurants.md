### Current Events

While browsing through and recreating some of the photos in Jay Boersma’s portfolio from 1976, we saw the photo of Mee Hong’s and were intrigued. We had previously heard of Luke’s restaurant and the upstairs Luau Hut which survived until the 90s. It was time to put a page together about some of the places that we could find photos of, and over the years, many visitors have told us their own story as well. 


### These Restaurants

#### Mee Hong

</figure>

Mee Hong was located at 102 Westminster Street, between [Providence National Bank]({% link _property/providence-national-bank.md %}) (#90) and [First Federal Bank]({% link _property/first-federal-bank.md %}) (#110). It was opened by the Chin family in 1938 and closed in 1979. The building was probably razed within 10 years. It might be one of the earliest Chinese restaurants in the city. 

_From the anecdotes:_ 

+ There was a plaque on the entrance which read _“through these portals pass the nicest people we know”_
+ The meal always included little dishes with pickled beets, coleslaw, or fries. Another visitor swears it was “Cole Slaw, Peas or Beets”
+ French bread was served with butter, like every other restaurant. But only Chinese restaurants in RI seem to do this 
+ Popular dishes seem to be a veal cutlet with brown gravy, chop suey, chow mein, and batter fried fish and chips


#### Luke’s Chinese American Restaurant

59 Eddy Street was home to Luke’s Restaurant, one of Providence’s early Chinese restaurants. In 1951, Tin Cheung Luke opened Luke’s with his son Henry. Located behind City Hall in the downtown Providence, the restaurant drew customers who worked nearby on the weekdays and out-of-town shoppers on the weekend. Food was cheap – a plate of chow mein was 90 cents and a plate of chow suey was only 5 cents more.

The restaurant occupied two stories. During the 1960s, the Lukes converted the upstairs dining room into a Polynesian themed restaurant called the “Luau Hut”, which served tropical cocktails and exotic dishes. The Luau Hut was decorated with straw wall covering, bamboo polls, and gigantic shell light fixtures. Downstairs the decorations were modest. People ate in formica covered booths.

59 Eddy Street still exists as the Edwin A. Smith Building as seen in the [Google Streetview photo](#photo-lukes-location-2019).

_From the anecdotes:_ 

+ Officer Luke of the Providence Police Department told someone that his branch of the LUKE family was related to [Keye Luke](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keye_Luke){:target="_blank"}, the actor from the golden age of Hollywood, and, Charlie Chan’s first son. 
+ Some considered Luke’s to be the best, most authentic New York- and California-style Chinese food outside of Boston. 
+ Popular dishes include pu pu platters; Ipswich fried clams with cole slaw; veal cutlet with brown gravy; combination plate with chow mein, fried rice and egg roll; eggrolls and lobster Cantonese in lobster sauce; and Scorpion bowls


#### Ming Garden

The longest lived of the Chinese restaurants, the Ming Garden was vital to life in downtown Providence. Open from 1941 to 1986, the restaurant was located at 141-143 Westminster Street, which had entrances on Westminster Street as well as Kennedy Plaza (now #68 Kennedy Plaza). The building was 2 and a half stories tall and dates to the late 19th century. 

During the 1950s, the Tows contracted a young architect named [Morris Nathanson](//archive.storycorps.org/interviews/morris-nathanson-on-being-a-17-year-old-medic-in-the-pacific-theatre/){:target="_blank"} to modernize the restaurant’s interior. Mr. Nathanson was well known for hospitality design, and his portfolio includes The China Inn in Pawtucket and the Johnson & Wales Culinary Arts Museum among others.

_From the National Register nomination form for the Downtown Providence Historic District, prepared by William McKenzie Woodward, Principal Historic Preservation Planner, 1984_

The Ming Garden (building constructed 1903): 3-story brick building with tiled modern entrance (similar entrance on Westminster Street side of building) and large plate-glass windows on upper stories; modern interiors by Morris Nathanson (ground floor) and Ira Rakatansky (upper floor). Though architecturally undistinguished outside, the building is heavily altered. The Ming Garden is a major Providence institution and the longest lived of a popular type, the Chinese restaurant, which has been an important part of the urban scene since the early 20th century.


_From the anecdotes:_

+ Ming’s Wings! People in the anecdotes certainly loved them. The recipes remains elusive. Some ideas for the recipe are included here in a [Providence Journal article](//www.providencejournal.com/article/20140806/entertainment/308069599){:target="_blank"}.
+ Ming’s Garden decor was more upscale than the other two listed here.
+ Other favorites dishes include sweet pork buns.

68 Kennedy Plaza still exists in much the same form as seen in [the 1950 photo](#photo-ming-garden-1950c).

### In The News

#### At Johnson & Wales, ‘Dinerman’ Richard Gutman was dean of food culture

_by Gail Ciampa_  
**[Providence Journal](//www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20161110/at-johnson-amp-wales-dinerman-richard-gutman-was-dean-of-food-culture){:target="_blank"}** | Nov 10, 2016 (abridged)

In 2009, Johnson & Wales and the [Culinary Art Museum] museum sponsored a series of discussions with Brown University to explore “Eating Chinese: Comestibles, Cuisine, Commerce and Culture.” It was just one of several collaborations among JWU and Brown’s Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America and the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage.

It featured what seemed the tiniest exhibit you’ll ever see, “Chow Mein, Chicken Wings, and Cheeseburgers” with a table setting from Mee Hong Restaurant ([1975 photo](#photo-mee-hong-jb-1975)), which was opened by the Chin family next to the Arcade in 1938. There was also Lily Tow’s typewriter [from Ming’s Garden, [typewriter photo ](#photo-ming-garden-typewriter)], used to compose newspaper ads for the Ming Garden restaurant.

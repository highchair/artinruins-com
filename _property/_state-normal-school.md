## The Normal School

The first Rhode Island State Normal School, for teacher predatory and training, opened in May of 1854 as one of the nation's first. It started in the Second Universalist Church building on Weybosset Street and then moved to Bristol for a time before being brought back to Providence in 1871. 

The building that was torn down was built in 1900 and financed by the State. In 1920, it was renamed  the Rhode Island College of Education. By 1958, the college was moved to its current campus in the Mount Pleasant section of Providence. The downtown building shifted to become home to the state's Education Department.

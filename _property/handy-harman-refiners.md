### Last Tenant

Coletta’s Downtown Auto Service, Inc. was the last tenant actively using any of these three buildings at the corner of Richmond, Eddy, and Marengo Streets. According to OpenCorporates.com[^1], **Handy & Harman** is a refinery operation still in operation, though we assume it is in a much different form. The earliest mention we could find of the company was from a 1930 City Directory listing the company under the heading “Smelters & Refiners” and the address of 425 Richmond.[^2] The 1926 map puts the company at this location a few years earlier.

We have not been able to find exactly _what_ Handy & Harman refined. With a location on the outskirts of the Jewelry District it is a good bet they refined material used in jewelry manufacturing. We also suppose it is just as likely they refined material for some important local manufacturing process, given their early inception.

The buildings and business were too small (dare we say inconsequential?) to have been catalogued in local historic districts or surveys.

#### Architecture

The buildings were built together over the course of about twenty years. The first garage and later garage building on the north end of the property are both one story brick structures with a parapet wall and garage door openings. The 1918 structure is narrow and deep with a symmetrical façade and a stepped parapet. The larger building has a slanted parapet and an old wooden hand-painted sign in which one can barely read “Refiners — Handy & Harman — (indistinguishable).” The smallest building on the south side of the property was originally a gas station. It is square with a chamfered corner, made of cement block, with garage door openings on the southern and western walls as well as a wooden ell on the western wall. 


### Current Events

The property is owned by Paolino Properties, who are holding onto it until an opportunity to make a tidy profit arises. Speculation includes opportunities to develop a medical building to house tenants who would take advantage of the proximity to Lifespan and Brown University complexes.


### History

The oldest structure in this small complex of three semi-attached buildings was built in 1918 according to maps. The larger building to the north appears on maps between 1920 and 1926. A gas station building appears to the south between 1926 and 1937.

#### Paolino to buy Jewelry District site. Ex-mayor expects to close in mid-June on 2-acre parcel that includes Coletta’s Garage

_by Kate Bramson_  
**Providence Journal** | June 9, 2016 (abridged)

Former Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., a large commercial real-estate property owner, has signed a purchase and sale agreement to buy **Coletta’s Garage** and the two acres of property adjacent to the Victory Place site in Providence now owned by the Lifespan health-care group.

Paolino declined to discuss the sale price, saying negotiations continue. He expects his family-owned Paolino Properties to close the real-estate deal for 425 Richmond St., by mid-June, he told The Providence Journal.

The towing and auto mechanic shop, which is relocating to 250 Niantic Ave. this week, is blocks from Brown University’s medical school and the now-vacant, former Route 195 land. It’s even closer to the [South Street Landing]({% link _property/south-street-power.md %}) project now under construction and expected by 2017 to house Brown administrative offices and a shared nursing education center for the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College. Coletta’s is tucked behind the [Tops Lighting & Supply building]({% link _property/barstow-stove-co.md %}) at 125 Point St. and across Richmond Street from a Brown-owned office building.

The building’s location was its appeal for Paolino, whose Paolino Properties owns, co-owns or manages more than 20 properties in Providence’s downtown. The presence of the nearby Ivy League school, the still-new partnership between URI, RIC and Brown in South Street Landing and Lifespan’s ownership of the property next door combined to interest Paolino in this property, he said.

Paolino praised Brown’s move beyond its traditional College Hill location and its dedication to building another campus in the city’s Jewelry District: “That’s what made it attractive for me to buy that building.”

Initially, Paolino said he’ll use the Coletta’s space for parking. He said others who are familiar with his agreement to buy it have contacted him to see if he’s interested in a “joint venture” or if he wants to sell it.

“And I’m open for anything that would be good for Providence, the neighborhood and my company,” Paolino said. […]

“Lifespan is doing a lot of work there and, quite frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t buy it,” Paolino said. […]

Phone calls to Coletta’s manager were not returned. City assessor’s records indicate the property is now owned by Black Duck Realty LLC and B&M Realty LLC and was assessed this year at $2.37 million.

### Redevelopment

This mill conversion project was one of the early ones in the City, but not the earliest. It was early for the spate of mill redevelopments that were to come in 2002 and beyond. Hard to place exactly, but we think this project was completed in 1998. A small single-story structure was removed for the new four-story entrance addition and elevator tower. The condos originally sold for $300 – $500,000 in 2000. 

The early photos of the construction show how much of an interior gut rehab this was. The floors and interior structure were almost completely replaced. The front half of the building is the only part that remains of the original mill. 

#### Francesca Woodman

Our first photo is an interior view circa mid-to-late 1970s of artist Francesca Woodman. The photo was shot and her life at RISD is chronicled by classmate and photographer [Betsy von Die](//www.consumergrouch.com/?p=6777){:target="_blank"}. Woodman’s photographs were largely shot inside many of the rooms of the Pilgrim Mills and have been collected by the [RISD Museum](//risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection?search_api_fulltext=Francesca+Woodman&field_type=All&op=){:target="_blank"} and the [Tate Modern](//www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/francesca-woodman-10512){:target="_blank"}, to name a few. She is an interesting and tragic figure, having taken her own life in 1981 at the age of 23. 

From a RISD Museum exhibition checklist:

> Made during Woodman’s sophomore year at RISD, the photographs reflect spaces that inspired her work. Woodman surreptitiously moved to an off-campus studio at Pilgrim Mills on North Main Street in Providence, where she lived and worked, as seen in Untitled (figure with door). She used her studio both as a backdrop against which her images were staged and as a prop that she deliberately manipulated, in this case by maneuvering the door. Untitled (sequence) shows Woodman and her close friend Sloan Rankin (who often modeled for Woodman and pressed the shutter when Woodman posed) in motion against the interior of Rankin’s apartment. The room becomes a container for their bodies, which were directed through the space by Woodman.


### Current Events

The redevelopment has been quite successful. Condo units in the building sell occasionally – one as recently as 2018 for a little over a million dollars. The ground-floor retail space has been home to Mill’s Tavern for almost 20 years. 


### History

An [1889 Sanborn Map](#photo-11) shows the following: “Bower’s Block, 103–109 North Main Street, Mattress Factory 1st (floor), Painting 3rd, Tailor Shop 4th.” A large 2-story livery stable is behind the bulk of the 4-story mill. In a [G.M. Hopkins 1937 cadastral map](#photo-12), the City of Providence is shown as the owner. Perhaps the city had to purchase the building to obtain right of way for the raised train tracks that carried the trains from behind Union Station to East Providence inside the [East Side Train Tunnel]({% link _property/east-side-train-tunnel.md %}).

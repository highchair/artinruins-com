    alt: 'A two and a half story former stable that looks like a former barn or an early, one door fire station. The exterior is brick and stone with a central garage door opening and windows on either side. The buildings plan is assymetrical, with a large cross gable roofline and a decorative elliptical shaped window in the center of the gable. Copper cladding along the rooflines and a central copper-clad cupola make this building very handsome.'

### Redevelopment

While much is known about the Goddard family, not much is known about “Hopeton House” at 160 Hope Street, the large estate that once stood at the corner of Governor Street in Providence. This stable is all that is left of that estate.

Built in 1885, this handsome stable building facing Benevolent Street was used as a Club House in the 1950s for a local theatre company (possibly affiliated with Brown University). Hopeton House was razed by 1937 (see [Maps](#maps)). A yellowed newspaper clipping in the John Hutchinson Cady Research Scrapbooks collection gives us [a blurry glimpse of what this large home looked like](//provlibdigital.org/islandora/object/islandora%253A5102){:target="_blank"} 

#### About Colonel Robert H. I. Goddard

Colonel Robert Hale Ives Goddard (1837–1916) was a Brown University graduate in 1858 and enlisted in the Civil War with an exemplary record, taking part in the first Battle of Bull Run, and later serving as an aide to General Ambrose Burnside. 

After the war, Colonel Goddard became president of **Goddard Brothers**, the managing agents of the firm of **Brown and Ives**, a land ownership and shipping business with a founding date of 1769.[^1] The company had mills in Blackstone, Massachusetts and in Smithfield and Warwick, Rhode Island, with holdings including the Ann & Hope Mill in Lonsdale. The deaths of his cousins, the Ives brothers, left the Goddards in charge of the family business enterprises.

Colonel Goddard served in the state Senate as an independent, was a leader in the burgeoning Progressive movement, and ran but lost as a Democrat for another state senate seat later in life. In 2009 he was inducted into the [Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame](//riheritagehalloffame.com/Colonel-Robert-Goddard/){:target="_blank"} (where much of this information was sourced).

In 1927, two of the Colonel’s children gave one of the family estates to the State of Rhode Island to be a park in memorarium. Nearly 490 acres of land on Ives Road in the Potowomut section of Warwick along with a 33-room mansion known as “The Oaks” opened in 1930 as Goddard Memorial Park.[^2]

Less is known about the Colonel’s sons who carry on his namesake — Robert Hale Ives Goddard Sr. (1880–1959) and Dr. Robert Hale Ives Goddard (1909–2003) — though Doctor Goddard is known as the father of modern rocketry.[^3]

### Current Events

The former stable has been a private home for many years. It has not been on the market for long enough that the usual real estate sites do not have any photos of the interior.


### History

**Robert H. I. Goddard stable**, c.1885. 2 1/2 stories; brick; hip roof with large off-center gable; ellipti­cal attic light; cupola; rusticated brownstone quoining, window, and entrance surrounds.

#### Maps

+ [1920–1921 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 2, Plate 21](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099192102){:target="_blank"} (page 28) — The stable is labeled as a 2 1/2 story brick (pink) building with a few small wooden (yellow) outbuildings. The large Hopeton House occupies the northeastern corner of George and Hope Streets while the southeastern corner of Hope and Benevolent is empty.
+ [1926–1927 G.M. Hopkins Insurance Map, Plate 19](https://sosri.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_c82222b2-d07d-45bf-9526-99a4d742c58b/){:target="_blank"} — Much the same as the 1921 map but for the newer homes to the north and east of the stable (circled in red).
+ [1937 G.M. Hopkins Insurance Map, Plate 19](https://sosri.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_d7d0bc6d-2c3f-4e1e-b9d1-e9b4eb580fa8/){:target="_blank"} — While the stable remains the same, the shape of the Hopeton House in the northeast corner of the block has changed enough that we think this is a newer home. This would place the demolition of the Hopeton House between 1927 and 1937.
+ [1920–1951 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 2, Plate 21](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099195102){:target="_blank"} (page 28) — The stable is now labelled “Club Ho.” for club house and says “Fr. Gables” (fr. for “former”) under that. The large Hopeton House is gone and a new brick dwelling is in its place. Another new dwelling is in place on the southwestern corner.

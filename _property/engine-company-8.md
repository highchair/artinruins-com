### Redevelopment

In the early 1990s — as Harrison and Hammond Street saw revitalization by the [Armory Revival Company]({% link designer/armory-revival-company.html %}) — this firehouse annex was converted to three residential apartments. The front (west) of the ground floor was one apartment, the back (east) of the ground floor was also an apartment, and the second floor was one large apartment. Since then, the owners live upstairs and use the rear apartment as an art studio.

The ground floor has sixteen-foot six-inch ceilings which needs a long rise of stairs to access the second floor. The stairs are too narrow for a chair lift, and the owners are in need of such accessible accommodations.

A proposed (and approved) new entry structure set against the south wall of the fire station annex will provide a new entrance for all units, storage space, an elevator, and an additional bedroom and bath for the second floor apartment. Architect Jack Ryan designed the addition to be a geometric contrast to the main building. A large expanse of the south wall is blank, having been a party wall to the former fire station. It will now expand south will additional living space and access.


### Current Events

The addition is approximately 18 feet by 26 feet with a height of 27 feet. It was approved for construction at a May 2024 meeting of the Providence Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">PHDC</span>) and construction started in the winter of 2024/2025.


### History

The application to the PHDC included notes from the architect and a history of the previous renovation in the 1990s. We include it here for reference:

The Annex was originally built as an extension of a Victorian Firehouse demolished several years ago. The South elevation of the Annex shows the residual material and arched openings of its earlier use. Project specifications call for the cleaning and repair of the existing wall as well as the addition of a masonry facing to provide a finished appearance. Arched openings and the superimposition of line and color will be in keeping with the restoration.

The West facade and front of the Harrison St. Firehouse offers some sensitive brick detailing along with a beautiful asymmetrical pattern of arched doorways and windows. A close reading of the bottom photograph shows the large arched bands of brick that form two prominent doors. The project specifications call for the removal of the present brick infill to be replaced by large half round windows with a glass slider in the large opening, while the smaller will serve as the entry door for Unit B.

The description below says “an addition to the south has been removed” but we now understand the remaining building is a smaller portion of an annex that was added onto a larger fire station.

_From the “Broadway-Armory Historic District” National Register nomination form, 1974_

**Hook & Ladder #2 and Atlantic Steamer #8 Fire Station** (ca 1870): 2-story; flat; brick former fire station; with bracketed cornice, granite window sills, and arched windows and engine-door openings. Several openings are filled in, and an addition to the south has been removed. Currently vacant. (C)

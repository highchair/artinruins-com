### Redevelopment

This project came before the Providence Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">PHDC</span>) in 2024. The proposal adds a third floor to the rear building at 298 and expands the third floor of the building at 300 as well. The addition and reconfiguration of the two buildings would result in 15 apartment units in total.

The current building at 300 is a wood frame, 2-1/2 story house with commercial space and an apartment on the ground floor and two apartments on second floor and attic. The third floor would be expanded with gable and shed dormers to allow for renovations and code compliant apartments. When completed, the building will maintain the ground floor commercial space along with nine three apartments each on floors one, two, and three.

The building at 298 is a wood frame, 2-story structure with two apartments on each floor. An additional third floor would match existing lower floor cladding and be capped with a new double hip roof and cornice. New windows will match existing in size and layout. After renovations, each floor will have two apartments for a total of six units.

The developer Aref Shehadeh is working as Providence Haus Management in collaboration with architect Ron Stevenson of South County Architecture and Design. Two additional architects, Mark Rapp of Acme Architects and Glen S. Fontecchio of Glen S. Fontecchio Architects, are consulting on historic district review standards, we assume. Both Mr. Rapp and Mr. Fontecchio have gone before the Providence Historic District Commission numerous times for changes to fenestration and exteriors.

The <span class="abbr">PHDC</span> suggested minimal changes to the designs to preserve the prominent gable roofline of 300 Broadway and to retain the double hip roof at 298 (the previous design had suggested a flat roof). Both suggestions were incorporated into a slight redesign which was then approved at the April 2024 meeting.


### Current Events

Construction has begun as of mid-2025. It seems like Schasteâ will remain open while construction is underway. 


### History

The Broadway-Armory district paperwork lists the house fronting Broadway as 298 but it is now known as 300. The house at the rear was just 298 rear, but is now 298.

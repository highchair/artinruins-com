### Redevelopment

The Peter Green House at Brown University was moved approximately 450 feet in one piece, from 142 Angell Street to 79 Brown Street, during a three-day moving process that began on Tuesday, July 31, 2007 and ended on August 2, 2007. The 300-ton house was one of the largest undertakings of the University’s 26 home-move projects. The relocation of the Peter Green House creates one of the open green spaces of The Walk, a series of linked open spaces and walking paths between the Pembroke Campus and Lincoln Field.

The house move preparations included removal of existing basement mechanical equipment as well as structural modifications to free the structure from the existing foundations. Construction crews supported the existing structures on wood cribbing and steel beams. The house mover placed hydraulic jacks under the beams and raised the house off of its existing foundations and transferred the loads to wheeled dollys. The house was pulled from the existing foundations, into Olive Street, rotated 90 degrees, and dragged up Olive Street to its new location. The structure was lowered onto its new foundation and restoration and renovation work continued until spring 2008.

Of course, all of this couldn’t have been done without a team. Lerner \| Ladds + Bartels Architects and H.V. Collins Company General Contractors designed, repaired and reconstructed original exterior elements while the Providence Revolving Fund consulted on the historically appropriate color scheme. Special attention was paid to the stained glass light that is an integral piece of the building’s impressive staircase. The restored exterior of the Peter Green House is a positive contribution to the Brown University campus. The attention dedicated to carefully restoring the exterior elements and materials of this wonderful building is indicative of the University’s ability to execute thoughtful historic preservation projects on its historic campus.


### Current Events

Since the move in 2007, [the Sharpe house has been moved to become its neighbor](//www.brown.edu/news/2020-02-05/history){:target="_blank"} to the north on Olive Street and the new performing center for the arts is under construction. 


### History

The last major renovation of this house took place in 1999, funded by a donation from Brown alumnus Peter Green in honor of his late wife, Mary-Jean Mitchell Green, which resulted in the renaming of the structure.

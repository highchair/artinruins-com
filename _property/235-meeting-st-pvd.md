### Reason for Demolition

The blocks bounded by Thayer, Euclid, Brook, and Cushing streets have been under enormous pressure to renovate since 2013. That was when the first big blow to this portion of the College Hill Historic District saw [the removal of nine houses]({% link _property/brook-meeting-euclid.md %}) to build the [new student apartment building at 257 Thayer]({% link _property/257-thayer-st.md %}). The argument for the demolition of those nine houses was “blight,” which in our opinion was self-inflicted by the owners so that they could sell to a developer and that developer could more easily make the argument to raze them all.

The pressure in this area of the district is nothing new. Brown University and its own institutional creep on the other side of Thayer Street has long put pressure on blocks of historic houses. Indeed, the institutional development here goes back 100 years or more.

But the removal of nine houses from the district in 2013 created a very slippery and very steep slope. Only three years later, in 2016, [seven more houses were lost]({% link _property/brook-meeting-cushing.md %}) on the next block for no immediate reason. The space remained a parking lot until Brown University decided to break ground on its [new student wellness center and dorms]({% link _property/wellness-center-residence-hall.md %}) in 2020.

Illustrations of these changes:
+ Aerial photos of the two blocks bounded by Thayer, Cushing, Brook, and Euclid in [2011](#photo-Thayer-Cushing-Brook-Euclid-2011), [2018](#photo-Thayer-Cushing-Brook-Euclid-2018), [2020](#photo-Thayer-Cushing-Brook-Euclid-2020), and [2022](#photo-Thayer-Cushing-Brook-Euclid-2022).

Since then, around 2018, on the other side of Euclid, [two more houses were razed]({% link _property/21-euclid-ave.md %}) for a new building on the corner of Brook Street. The former Stereo Discount Center on Angell Street was partially demolished and turned into apartments around the same time. More houses on Angell Street were renovated beyond recognition in 2020.

Illustrations of these changes:
+ Aerial photos of the two blocks bounded by Thayer, Euclid, Brook, and Waterman in [2014](#photo-Thayer-Euclid-Brook-Waterman-2014), [2018](#photo-Thayer-Euclid-Brook-Waterman-2018), [2020](#photo-Thayer-Euclid-Brook-Waterman-2020), and [2022](#photo-Thayer-Euclid-Brook-Waterman-2022).

The College Hill Historic District may still have a strong, beating heart on and around Benefit Street, and includes many of the older structures of Brown University and the former Pembroke University. But in less than 10 years, these four blocks saw the loss of twenty late-19th century houses and the conversion of 5 more away from historic status.

Richard C. Youngken said it best when he warned “the integrity of the National Register district in this area may be compromised by this action,”[^1] when referring to the demolition of nine homes in 2013. He was the historic planner hired by residents living near the proposed 257 Thayer Street site in 2012, when they were trying to fight demolition approval by the City Plan Commission.

### Current Events

A Thayer Street District Management Authority meeting heard details about the plan to replace 235 Meeting Street in their November 2020 meeting. The developer Paul Boutros plans to construct 4-story building with commercial space for a restaurant on the first and second floors with the third and fourth floors containing four apartments each. <abbr title="Providence Preservation Society">PPS</abbr> objected to a few of the design details and the architect went back and forth on a few plans. The original date of construction was Fall of 2021 but the building did not come down until August 2022. [^2]

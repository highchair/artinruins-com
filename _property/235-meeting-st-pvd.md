### Reason for Demolition

This was the only pre-1900 home left on the block. The bulk of the block — nine houses — were [demolished in 2013]({% link _property/brook-meeting-euclid.md %}) in favor of a new privately-developed student apartment building called [257 Thayer]({% link _property/257-thayer-st.md %}). This final hold out was surrounded by the new residence structure and under market pressure to be converted as well.

The building, from the outside, did not appear to be in terrible shape. It was occupied until its demolition by a ground floor restaurant business. In the tax records, the owner was listed as “Boutros Salo & Boghos LLC.”

This property loss is part of [our essay about the erosion of the College Hill Historic District]({% link _essays/erosion-of-college-hill-historic-district.md %}).


### Current Events

A Thayer Street District Management Authority meeting heard details about the plan to replace 235 Meeting Street in their November 2020 meeting. The developer Paul Boutros plans to construct 4-story building with commercial space for a restaurant on the first and second floors with the third and fourth floors containing four apartments each. <abbr title="Providence Preservation Society">PPS</abbr> objected to a few of the design details and the architect went back and forth on a few plans. The original date of construction was Fall of 2021 but the building did not come down until August 2022. [^2]

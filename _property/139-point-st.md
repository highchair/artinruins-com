To the right of the facade is a bright blue painted cement block structure and to the left is a plywood clad cement block structure that serves as the main entrance off of a parking lot.'

### Redevelopment

An understated redevelopment of a mid-century industrial structure into a modern office space. The building was not built like others in the area — it was built cheaply and presumably quickly to give home to support businesses for the jewelry and metal finishing industries, no doubt. 

The redesign encased the former loading dock area in a glass atrium-like structure, set back from the street. The clerstory design opens the interior to additional natural light. Bamboo was planted as a natural screen in front of the large central windows. 


### Current Events

The building remains the same bright blue though the plywood cladding has darkened as a product of not being maintained properly. The wood should be re-sealed every few years. The bamboo plantings have been replaced with other plantings. 


### History

The history is spotty on this building. Thanks to the anecdotes I was able to verify and disprove a few things:

+ According to real estate website, the building sits on a 19,602 sq ft lot with parking, and interior space is 10,242 sq ft
+ The building(s) appears in aerial photos between 1951-52 and 1962. In a 1956 Sanborn Map, this single structure appears as three different structures. The way they are arranged, however, makes it very possible that all three were combined together with smaller connecting structures. In the 1972 aerial photo, they all appear under one roof. The Sanborn map shows “Cutlery Manufacturing” at this location
+ ITEM Product Development was the first tenant in the converted space from 2000 to about 2008. Lifespan then purchased the building, ITEM moved to a large space in Cranston, and the Lifespan Development Office now occupies the building
+ Gallimaufry Good Food, Inc. was located at **103 Point Street** as a catering business, registered with the State in 1992. The registration was dissolved in 2000. 103 Point Street is the location of the former Olga’s, _not_ this building. A related company owned by Paul and Patricia Millete — Burgess Oakes, LLC — entered into a court battle over the liquidation of assets when Gallimaufry closed 

Of course, if anyone else has further information about this building please let us know in the anecdotes.

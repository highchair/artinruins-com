### Proposal

This new construction occupies a lot that sat vacant since at least 1950. It might have been green space for the adjacent [Saint Raymond’s Rectory]({% link _property/st-raymond-rectory.md %}) and [<span class="u__sr-only">Saint Raymond’s </span>Convent]({% link _property/st-raymond-convent.md %}), as all lots were part of Saint Raymond’s campus. The lot subdivision line was moved prior to construction to allow enough drainage and permeable surface for the new structure.

The partially sunken basement only occupies half of the footprint and is used for storage and utility. The first floor has an entrance area and has three apartments — two studios and three one-bedrooms. Floors two, three, and four have one studio and five one-bedrooms for a total of five studios and eighteen one-bedroom apartments.

The units seem well proportioned but the plans did not list the square footage of each unit. Bedrooms have a wall of built-in storage, while the living areas have adjoining galley kitchens.


#### Design Reception

There have not been any press mentions of the building that we have found.

The forms and style seem to fit Jack Ryan’s aesthetic. The new addition to the [former Miriam Hospital]({% link _property/old-miriam-hospital.md %}) on the West Side, as well as the new construction on the East Side at Matilda Street follow similar visual and spatial organizing ideas.


### Current Events

The building looks like it will be completed by the fall of 2025. [The architect’s website](https://www.jackryanarchitect.com/gallery24eighthstreet) does not give much detail but it looks to be tracking construction progress and will likely have more details once the opening can be announced.

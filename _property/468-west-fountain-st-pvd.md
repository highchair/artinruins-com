### Proposal

Case number 19-043 went before the City Plan Commission a few times starting in 2019 and extending into October 2020. The previous auto body shop was demolished and in its place a four-story, 34 unit apartment building was constructed. The lot was about 8,500 square which means that parking was not required — Parking is not required if lots measure less than 10,000 SF in the C-2 zone. The building is 45 feet in height, under the 50 foot limit, and  multi-family dwellings are allowed by right.

The approved plan included seven apartments on the first floor, with eight on each of the three upper stories and three one-bedroom units in the basement. Most of the units are one bedroom with some two bedrooms included. The main building entrance to the lobby is located at the corner of West Fountain and Whitaker Street — a small right-of-way. Bike storage is provided in the basement.


### Design Reception

We’re sure we sound like a broken record when it comes to these buildings. Design-wise, it is nothing special. As with most new buildings, ornamentation is limited to changing facing material instead of providing any traditional design elements like fenestration or cornice work or brackets or things like that. The design by ZDS is typical of their cheaper-to-build designs.

On the other hand, the building brings much needed living space to a desirable neighborhood. The quality of the units is not something we can comment on. Are they small with thin walls and cheap finishes? Perhaps. Rent starts at $1750 as of 2025 according to Apartments.com which seems high, but we are likely out of touch with the current market. The pictures look nice enough while the building is new. Let’s see how it holds up after a few years.

The new building replaced a single-story cinder-block building used for auto repair with a large driveway. Along with 473 Battey Street around the corner, this end of the block bounded by Battey, West Fountain, and Washington Streets has turned from primarily commercial/industrial to primarily residential.

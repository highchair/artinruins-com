### Last Tenant

The On Leong Merchants Association was an owner from roughly 1977[^4] until 2006, when the association sold to new owners Tony & Tina Siravo.[^3] The [On Leong association](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Leong_Chinese_Merchants_Association) had its start in 1893 in Manhattan, New York, and this local association was likely related. Their main headquarters was here until 2002.[^5]

The building’s history with the On Leong Association makes it an important part of Providence’s Chinese-American history. The Association was forced to move from its original location near Empire Street after the City decided to widen the street and demolish all of the original Chinatown.

Not much can be found about the building from its early days as a Columbia Bicycle retail location, the first american bicycle manufacturer. Colonel Albert Pope founded the bicycle industry in the United States starting in 1877. By 1897, the Pope Manufacturing Co. held over 50 patents. The Columbia Manufacturing facility was opened in nearby Westfield, Massachusetts, producing bicycles and motorbikes. By 1900, Columbia was the largest bicycle manufacturer in the world.[^6]

In the late 1890’s, Pope Manufacturing started producing automobiles. Two gasoline-powered models were offered at this location as well as an electrical one called the _Waverly_. The early advertisements we have snippets of did not mention the specifics, but with its price of $850, it must have been a model described by a Wikipedia entry:

> The 1904 [Pope-Waverley Road Wagon](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope-Waverley) was a smaller wagon model. It could seat 2 passengers with an open box at the rear for cargo and sold for US$850. The single electric motor was situated at the rear of the car and produced 3 hp (2.2 kW). The car used a 24-cell battery and could travel at 5 or 15 mph (8.0 or 24.1 km/h).


### Current Events

New owners are exploring ways to revitalize the upper floors of the building. We hope to learn more as the work progresses.


### History

Not much turned up in the Providence Journal Archives. We searched for all addresses (17 through 25 Snow Street) as well as “Alleycat” and “Columbia Building.” We only found a few mentions:

In 1997, a bar called **Sgt. Peppers Pub** was shut down for two months because of loitering and other problems; manager Ron Pratt and owner Deborah Marandola. The bar was on the ground floor of the Columbia Building, which has apartments on the second and third floors. **Snow Book Store**, at 25 Snow St., was next door to the bar.[^1] It was listed as an “adult” book store.[^2]

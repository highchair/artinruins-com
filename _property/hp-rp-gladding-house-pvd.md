### Redevelopment

This project came before the Providence Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">PHDC</span>) in 2024. The proposal would add a fourth floor to the building, set back from the perimeter to allow outdoor patio space but also to prevent changing the historic roofline details. The addition and reconfiguration of the building would result in 14 apartment units in all.

> The owner proposes an addition to an existing three-story building. Current structure contains ground floor commercial spaces with apartments/commercial space on floors two and three. The proposed changes include renovations to floors two and three resulting in five (5) apartments on each floor. The proposed addition is a new fourth floor with four (4) apartments. Infrastructure changes include extending stairs and elevator to fourth floor along with installation of a fire sprinkler system throughout. The owner is also looking to replace windows on floors two and three and add two windows, one each on floors two and three to accommodate reconfiguration of apartments.

The developer Aref Shehadeh is working as Providence Haus Management in collaboration with architect Ron Stevenson of South County Architecture and Design. Two additional architects, Mark Rapp of Acme Architects and Glen S. Fontecchio of Glen S. Fontecchio Architects, are consulting on historic district review standards, we assume. Both Mr. Rapp and Mr. Fontecchio have gone before the Providence Historic District Commission numerous times for changes to fenestration and exteriors.

Interestingly, the renderings (photos #5 and 6) show a non-descript new building east of the house in the current parking lot. We have not seen additional plans for a new structure here, but clearly Mr. Shehadeh is interested in pursuing more apartment units.


### Current Events

The fourth floor addition and interior apartment renovations are under construction as of mid-2025.


### History

_From the “Broadway-Armory Historic District” National Register nomination form, 1974_

Hartshorn, architect. 3-story; flat; brick monumental Italianate double house; with consoled pediments rising above bracketed eaves above each end bay of the 4-bay facade, and olive-stone lintel window caps on original windows, now primarily obscured on the facade by a 2-story bay window on the east end and a 2-story, 2-bay storefront addition on the west. (C) Henry B. and Royal P. Gladding, brothers and partners in a book and stationery store on Westminster Street, built this at a cost of about $30,000. Early 20th c. house located at rear.

### Last Tenant

Benny’s was a home-grown chain of hardware/homeware stores throughout Rhode Island — it was home to “a little bit of everything.” It started in 1924 with a storefront on Fountain Street, Downtown Providence. They survived big-box and online competition until October 2017, when the last of their stores closed. It wasn’t a going-out-of-business story as much as it was a retirement story. The retail landscape shifted so much, and the stores were not growing their reach. A younger generation did not have the same affinity for locally-owned, quirky, low-bottom-line retail. 

A great [ode to Benny’s was written by Barry Fain for East Side Monthly](https://eastsidemonthly.com/stories/bidding-bennys-farewell,25156). 

#### Architecture

The building itself is an “L” shaped box — nothing terribly interesting. The huge letters adorning the front and back of the building are great, though. We also love the small white, silver, and red tiles. 


### Current Events

The site has been vacant since 2017. Its recent upgrade in paint and window treatment has gotten the stark black and white look popular with Thomas Badway and **Dean Auto Collision Center/Richmond Motor Sales and Rentals**. They are located at 700–740 North Main Street and own buildings in and around that main address.

Christopher Maselli, Esq. is listed as the Agent for Richmond Motor Sales and as the Agent associated with <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ri/001762771">1100 North Main LLC</a> as well. The mailing address for that corporation is 1052 North Main Street, the address of The Law Office of Thomas E. Badway & Associates, LLC. The also are associated with the former [Autocar & Studebaker Trucks dealership at 36 Branch Avenue]({% link _property/autocar-studebaker-trucks.md %}).

Towards the end of October 2025, a For Lease sign was added to the building. Apparently the site was prepared without a tenant already lined up.


### History

No formal history. The property shows up on an aerial photograph from 1972, and the previous photo from 1962 shows different structures.

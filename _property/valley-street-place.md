### Reason for Demolition

The Valley Street Place flea market and associated tenants seem to have closed in 2019. Rumors on Reddit stated that the Providence VA purchased the property in 2020 for $1.4 million, but we have not been able to find a news story or press release to verify this.

In a 2022 Google Streetview photo, one can see a banner hung on the fence that says “Providence VA Medical Center Staff parking Annex.” This is the closest to primary source proof that we have been able to get. There are no public plans about what they plan to build here, if anything.

#### Tacqueria Taconaza

The Taqueria Taconaza was one of our favorite authentic Mexican taquerias. They operated out of a trailer with a wooden shack built around it and had the best “mixtale” (we swear they were called something like this but we can’t verify) burritos with chicharrón, chirizo, and carne asada as well as daily homemade pico de gallo. They closed and moved between June 2011 and 2014 according to Google Streetviews and the Providence Historical Aerial Viewer. They moved to 298 Pocasset Ave, Providence, RI.


### Current Events

We will continue to keep an eye on this location to see what develops.


### History

The property was built recently, by historic standards, so it does not appear in the usual places. It does not appear on a 1956 Sanborn Map ([Volume 3, Plate 82](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099195603) page 88). It does seem to appear in a 1962 aerial photo — though it is blurry, there seems to be something there as compared to the previous 1952 photo.

Business start to appear in Polk’s Providence starting in 1964:

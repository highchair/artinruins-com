### Current Events

This large complex is mixed light industrial and storage along with nearby [Easton Burnham Machine/]({% link _property/easton-burnham-machine.md %}) (now razed), which was proposed to be mixed live/work studio space. 297 Barton Street is now light industrial, and 195 Weeden Street, the old powerhouse (center of photo #3), is also light industrial.

#### More Photos

_From the Pawtucket Mill Building survey, prepared by the Preservation Society of Pawtucket, 1990, reprinted 1995_

The former **Manville Jenckes Company** mills (NE Paper Tube) is a tightly packed group of 4-story brick mills and two 2-story weave sheds. Construction was begun on the site in the 1880s, and the last mill was built in 1919.

**Conrad Manufacturing** used to occupy the simple two story sawtooth weave shed. The sawtooth design allowed the most natural light onto the floor. The brick work has been repaired and most of the mortar looks new. On the second floor beneath the sawtooth roof are a set of new windows, very nice arched stationary sets with two 4 over 4 sliding windows. The round windows along each point of the sawtooth have also been repaired or replaced.

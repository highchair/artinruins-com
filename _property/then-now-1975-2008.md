### About the Project

Some time in 2008 we stumbled across the website of Jay Boersma. He was a <span class="abbr">RISD</span> graduate student who used Sunday mornings in Providence as his time to explore and work on his portfolio. Originally from the Midwest, Jay was fascinated by Providence’s mix of older architecture with more modern interpretations as the City tried to reinvent itself. Since shops were not allowed to be open on Sundays and Downtown had a strict overnight parking ban, Providence was his “abandoned set on a movie studio back lot”.

We set about to recreate these scenes as closely as possible. It was fun to hunt down the locations. His original photos are much better as photos — composition, color, contrast, and overall exposure. They are really beautiful, without even mentioning the great old signs and embellishments that we have lost today. Mr. Boersma also had the advantage of a 4x5" large format camera. This means that the planes of the lens and the negative are independent, allowing him to skew perspective and make tall buildings shoot straight up, while most cameras with smaller lenses bow buildings as they rise from the ground. We did our best to use the trickery of Photoshop to correct these effects and stay as true to the original as possible. Still, we are not professional photographers with great equipment (but we think we got pretty damn close). Hope you enjoy!

### Reason for Demolition

116 Waterman, otherwise known as **Finlandia**, was sold in 2020 to a private developer. Around the same time, its neighbor to the north at 382 Brook Street was also purchased. Both lots, numbers AP 12 260 and 180, are owned by the same developer who proposed a new five-story building starting in the spring of 2022.

Walter Bronhard and Brook Holding, LLC were applicants proposing to demolish these two existing homes in the College Hill Historic District. They want to construct a new mixed-use five story building with a commercial ground floor and 25 dwelling units. They sought a dimensional adjustment to maintain a height of 58’ and five stories where 50’ and four stories are allowed by right in the zone. They also requested a design waiver for locating residential development within 20’ of a main street, which was approved contingent on the use of noise regulatory devices and 24/7 security for the life of the project.

Few presentations in opposition were heard — the Providence Preservation Society was one of the few [objectors to the variances](//ppsri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023-02-116-Waterman-PPS.pdf){:target="_blank"} in a letter addressed to the City Planning Commission.

The loss of these properties is part of [our essay about the erosion of the College Hill Historic District]({% link _essays/erosion-of-college-hill-historic-district.md %}).


### Current Events

We are waiting for construction fencing to go up any day now. The project got design approval, so now it is waiting for additional permitting and construction financing to clear.

_From an archived webpage about Brown Association of Cooperative Housing (BACH)_

**Finlandia** is located at 116 Waterman Street, next to a stoplight and the Sciences Libarary [sic]. A part of BACH since 1994, it has seen a fair amount of good-hearted trouble. With eyes on the prize, though, recent years have been much more easy-going, filled with memories scrawled across the kitchen walls.

Finlandia's cluttered basement is home to the BACH office, which is where all the great work of our organization is processed and clumsily filed.

### Redevelopment

We are unsure what is happening with this property. It has been decaying since we noticed it in 2018 and likely before that. There is a sign on the fence for “Bahra’s Development Company” but we think the fence it is attached to is actually the adjacent property to the north.

We couldn’t find much about this place other than the tax records which list 25 Bough LLC as the owner. OpenCorporates and the Secretary of State have a 2024 Annual Report on file, in which the company purpose is listed as “A COMMERCIAL / COMMUNITY, MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT LOCATED AT 25 BOUGH STREET, PROVIDENCE, RI 02909 (OLNEYVILLE, CENTRAL PROVIDENCE, RI), STEM INCUBATOR AND RESILIENCY HUB.” An empty lot at 20 Dike Street is also listed as owned by the 25 Bough LLC entity.


### Current Events

The building is surrounded by construction fencing and has been since our 2018 photo. It is not being repaired or maintained but it is also not being actively torn down.

A website exists for [25Bough.com](https://www.25bough.com), which promotes a 5-story building in this spot which looks like it retains a little bit of the existing features. It promises shared event space, co-working, museum, and other community-oriented mission-driven ideas.


### History

#### Maps

+ [1908 L.J. Richards Insurance Map](#photo-), Plate 15 (private collection) — A narrow building in pink (indicating brick) fronts Dike Street labeled “W.M. Hughes Co.” There are three different wooden structures at the corner of Dike and Bough. The brick building at this location seems to be the two-story portion of the larger building in the next map, which would make this portion of the building older than the rest.
+ [1920–1921 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 4, Plate 14](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099192104) (page 17) — A gray brown building occupies the entire southeastern corner of Bough and Dike Streets. It has labels that read as follows: Repair Shop 2nd, capacity 60 cars, Reo Service Station, Fireproof construction, built 1917, concrete floor and roof, brick walls, heat: steam, lights: electric.
+ [1926 G.M. Hopkins Insurance Map, Plate 36](https://sosri.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_294d2dde-38f1-4434-bad1-8eebdadb916d/) — A pink/red building (indicating brick) is labeled “‘REO’ Wm. Hughes Co. Inc.”

Now labeled as “Private Garage.” No major alterations.

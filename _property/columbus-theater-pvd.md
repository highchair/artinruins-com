### A brief History of Theaters in Providence

Researching this building was the first time we had heard that it opened as the Columbus Theater, was renamed the Uptown Theater four years later, and then in 1962, under new ownership, returned to is original name. It’s funny, therefore, how the new owners want to go back to the “old” name which is not actually the original.

From the late 1800s through 1930, Providence’s theater business boomed. In 1890, the city’s main venue was the Providence Opera House (opened 1871), which hosted stage plays and opera. By the early 1900s the first nickelodeons and vaudeville halls appeared. Popularity rose, and the 1910s saw the construction of grand downtown theaters such as [the Majestic](https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/281) (opened 1917, 3000 seats, now Trinity) and the [RKO Albee](https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6380) (opened 1919, 2314 seats, demolished 1970s) were built. Neighborhoods also got their own cinemas and in the late 1920s, Providence hit its peak. By 1930 practically all theaters had been wired for sound, and ticket sales were extremely strong through the early Depression years.

After about 1930 the first signs of decline appeared. The grand 19th-century stage houses closed as movies took over. The Great Depression and the rise of free entertainment via the radio reduced spending money and desire to leave home. Later, drive-in movie theaters and television after 1940 continued to dwindle theater ticket sales.

Those that survive today, therefore, are palaces to entertainment that should be cherished. Providence is lucky to have a few stand outs surviving, namely the former Majestic, the Loew’s State/Paramount Theatre which is now PPAC, the [Avon Theater](https://www.cinematreasures.org/theaters/465), and the Columbus Theater. Each boasts a highly decorated interior that makes going to the movies or an event feel special.

_From [Cinema Treasures](https://www.cinematreasures.org/theaters/5929) (abridged)_

The Columbus Theatre was conceived and built by its first owner, Domenic Annotti. The architect for the theatre was Oresto DiSaia, also known for the now-demolished [Metropolitan Theatre](/property/beneficent-house/#development) and for some work on Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The architectural features of the theatre’s interior include evocative frescoes and murals by artist George di Felice. Among these is “The Music Sensation,” a study of the effects of music upon mankind. The Columbus Theatre and Loew’s State (now Providence Performing Arts Center) remain Rhode Island’s two finest surviving historic movie theatres.

The Columbus Theatre opened on November 1, 1926 with the film “La Boheme” with Lillian Gish and John Gilbert in addition to stage programs. Seating was provided for 1,492 in orchestra and mezzanine levels. By the time 1929 had arrived, the theatre was renamed the Uptown Theatre and continued a long career as primarily a second-run house catering to a large adjacent population in Providence’s Federal Hill neighborhood. […]

Because of the nearby ethnic Italian population, for many years the theatre was a focal point for some Italian stage plays, musical events, and Italian movies, although recent Hollywood movies were the mainstay. In 1962, under the new ownership of Jon S. Berberian, the theatre reassumed its original name of Columbus Theatre. Second-run programs continued to be shown until the theatre began an art-house policy that was to expand with the sectioning off of the balcony into a separate “Studio Cinema” in November of 1965. This discreet division resulted in Providence’s first twin cinema.

Art and specialty programs were to play both screens, and the theatre was a rival to the Avon Cinema on Thayer Street for the quality of its programs. Sex-laden films proved to do better business after a while, and within a few years outright pornography became the mainstay on both screens […]. This policy […] was to continue for three decades until around 2001 when first-run art house programming was re-introduced, then abandoned because of insufficient audiences.

The theatre also became the home of the R.I. International Film Festival. That organization maintains its offices in the theatre building, does an annual August festival, and special programs throughout the year. When the Cable Car Cinema closed in May 2018, they moved their operation into the Columbus Theatre. […]

#### Comedy Connection Owners Acquire Columbus Theatre in Providence — And Will Revert to Old Name

_by GoLocalProv Business Team_  
**Go Local Providence** | October 24, 2024

The Columbus Theatre in Providence has new owners. 

In May, the former ownership had announced its closure; Jon Berberian and his family had owned the theatre for more than 60 years.

Now, it is back. 

Cory Brailsford and David Fiorillo, who are behind Comedy Connection and Black Duck Tavern, on Thursday announced their acquisition of the Columbus Theatre.

According to the new owners, it will be restored to its former name, the Uptown Theatre, and will “undergo renovations and updates before reopening.”

“We are thrilled to bring back the Uptown Theatre name and honor its legacy,” said Brailsford. “Our goal is to preserve its historic charm while introducing exciting new programming that will appeal to a wide range of audiences.”

“The Columbus Theatre has been a cornerstone of Providence’s arts scene for generations. We’re honored to have the opportunity to breathe new life into this beloved institution,” said Fiorillo. 

##### Moving Forward 

The renovations are expected to enhance the theatre’s infrastructure while maintaining its classic aesthetic, say the new owners.

Once completed, the Uptown Theater will join the Comedy Connection in offering entertainment options to the community.

The Comedy Connection, which was opened in 1989, has seen a major revitalization under the ownership of Brailsford and Fiorillo for the last 14 years. 

Known for hosting major comedy acts, it has become a staple in the New England comedy scene.

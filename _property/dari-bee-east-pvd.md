### Redevelopment

It was announced in early 2024 that the owners of the Dari Bee were looking to sell. The prime real estate along the bike path was asking a quarter of a million dollars.

Business seems to be brisk in warmer months. Richmond Square has seen much business growth and turnover in the past few years as new owners have redeveloped the buildings and a new multi-unit apartment building was constructed by ONE Neighborhood Builders. With Borealis coffee, Union Bistro, and other nearby business, the Dari Bee will hopefully continue to be a bright spot along the bike path for a cold treat.


### Current Events

The Dari Bee was open again in the summer of 2024. The listing at Residential Properties has been removed. The tax assessor’s database for this address continues to list Rosalie Silva as the owner.


### History

An obituary states William Hevey operated the stand from 1950 until 1987. The “For Sale” news post mentions someone else, though, bu the name of John Tait. Not dates are mentioned.

A Sanborn Map from 1956[^1] shows a structure at this location and an aerial photo from 1962[^2] shows the same building shape. It may or may not be the same building as what we see today — it is difficult to tell based on the shape alone.

####  East Providence ice cream shop for sale

_by Sarah Bawden_  
**WPRI.com** | February 9, 2024

An iconic Riverside Square ice cream shop is on the market.

Dari Bee, which first opened back in 1960, was listed for sale on Thursday.

The Bullocks Point Avenue ice cream shop is situated off of the East Bay Bike Path and is popular during the summer months.

An online listing for the ice cream shop notes that Dari Bee “has long been a favorite destination for both locals and tourists.”

The ice cream shop features a front canopy with large windows to serve customers, as well as a full basement with ample storage space. It also boasts a good-sized parking lot and concrete patio with numerous picnic tables where guests “can enjoy their treats.”

The asking price for the ice cream shop is $750,000. The property was last sold in 1997 for $78,000, according to the city’s online assessment database.

Dari Bee — which opens seasonally and is currently closed for the winter — offers a variety of sweets and treats, including hard and soft serve ice cream, milkshakes, sundaes, banana splits and frozen lemonade.

The ice cream shop was originally established by local resident John Tait, and was later sold to the Silva family, according to a city report on Riverside Square released last year.

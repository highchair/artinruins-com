### The Mystery

Just what was “Hope Cycle and Auto Supply”, how long did it last, and when did the slender triangular building that housed it get removed from Charles Street? Because of the oil (gas?) pumps on the narrowest end of the building, we assume the “Cycle” in “Hope Cycle” meant motorcycle. 

The façade of the building has much writing on it, including: **OIL PARTS TIRES TOOLS** with **WHOLESALE RETAIL** under that and in script lettering **Auto Supplies**. We found these photos as part of two different National Register nominations — one for the [American Screw Company]({% link _property/american-screw-co.md %}), and one for the [Moshassuck Square Historic District]({% link list/moshassuck-square-historic-district.html %}) (which included the American Screw Company).

The original Canal House building at 125 Charles Street is the only portion of these photos from the early 1970s still standing. A massive fire in the later 70s took out the old Bay State Mill to the left and most of the old Eagle Mills to the right. A burned out hull of one of the mills was left standing for a little while before that was removed as well. 

Google searches for this business and this address did not turn up too much. [A thread about this building on Facebook](//www.facebook.com/artinruinsweb/posts/3315507691805083) has not revealed much detail yet. Do you know more about this business or building, or both?

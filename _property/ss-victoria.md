### Concept & History

When we heard about this steamboat-turned-floating-restaurant, we were delighted. And then we were surprised that we had it for about four years and then never again. For a water-centric city, it is surprising that this concept has not been repeated. 

The S.S. Victoria was a 106-foot steamboat built in New Jersey in the 1920s to ferry supplies and patients to municipal institutions on New York City’s Roosevelt Island. A restaurant designer in Philadelphia who specializes in converting old boats into restaurants, Alfred Johnston, reconditioned it in 1978 and brought it from New London, Conn. to Providence. It was opened as a restaurant the next year.[^1]

It could seat up to 150 patrons.[^2] A year later, restauranteur Anthony “Tony” Mastronardi purchased it and ran it with his family, including his wife Janice, until 1983.

Mastronardi then sold the S.S. Victoria to George Costa, a developer from New Jersey, who planned to bring it back and berth it in Hoboken.[^3] He was taking advantage of a $10-million historic waterfront renewal[^4] but was not officially invited to take part.[^5] The steamer sunk shortly after it arrived in New Jersey.[^6]

[^5]: “…there will be a floating restaurant in Hoboken, much to the chagrin of Mrs. Manogue, Salvatore Samperi of the Port Authority and Paul Rotondi, chairman of the Waterfront Advisory Committee, who admitted at its last meeting that Mr. Costa was within his rights to dock a boat in Hoboken, even if it was not part of the committee’s overall redevelopment plans.” — Jackman, Tom.

Mastronardi and family went on to lead or be part of many other restaurant ventures, including their own Victoria House restaurant on Rathbone Street in Providence[^7] — which in 1993 became the home of the second incarnation of the Living Room nightclub and concert venue.[^8]

Owned and operated by Anthony and Janice Mastronardi (who previously operated the S.S. Victoria on the Providence River), Victoria House, on Rathbone Street between Promenade and Valley Streets, reflects their hospitable approach to their patrons.

#### Yes, Victoria — There is a home in N.J.

_by Donna Lee_  
**Providence Journal** | August 17, 1983 (abridged)

The S.S. Victoria, the old steamboat that had been turned into a restaurant, was towed out of Providence Wednesday afternoon, headed for a new berth in New Jersey. 

Employees gathered nearby at The Hot Club to wave goodbye and toast the Victoria with champagne as it left. Customers, saddened that the Victoria was leaving, had crowded the restaurant the last week of its operation, then partied late into the night in the final farewell. 

“We closed the restaurant July 2, and it went out on the moon tide (3:30p.m.) August 10,” said Anthony D. Mastronardi, who had operated the boat as a restaurant since 1980. 

The S.S. Victoria had to pass under the hurricane barrier to head for Quonset Point. It was a tight squeeze, even at low tide. After the 18-foot smokestack was removed, Mastronardi estimated that there was about six inches clearance. In Quonset, the smokestack was reinstalled. The Victoria was expected to reach New Jersey this week.

Mastronardi said the new owner, developer George Costa, plans to use the boat as a restaurant in Hoboken, N.J., and keep the name S.S. Victoria. 

The R.I. Fish Co. pier between the Hurricane barrier and Fox Point bridge is empty where the S.S. Victoria was once berthed. Mastronardi is studying the possibilities of a restaurant-lounge. “I’m considering a permanent structure,“ Mastronardi said. 

“Boats have a lot of problems,” he explained. “You can’t expand, and the kitchen is cramped.”

The S.S. Victoria, a 106-foot steamboat, was built in Elizabeth, N.J., in the 1920s to ferry supplies and patients to municipal institutions on New York City’s Welfare Island, now called Roosevelt Island. At the time, the boat was called “The Welfare.”

Alfred Johnston, a restaurant designer in Philadelphia who specializes in converting old boats into restaurants, brought the boat from New London, Conn., to Providence in October, 1978 and reconditioned it. It was opened as a restaurant the next year, and Mastronardi bought it in 1980. 

This summer, Mastronardi, who is president of the R.I. Chapter of Confrerie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs, held a dinner party on the S.S. Vitoria for members of his gourmet group. It was a gastronomic tour of Italy by chef Stephen Plante, and the food was excellent… baby ravioli with warm walnut sauce, baby lamb chops with sweet roasted peppers, dandelion salad, venison aaa Cacciatore. […]

[…] Mastronardi is considering his next venture, and New Jersey will soon be welcoming a floating restaurant from Rhode Island. Arrival of the S.S. Victoria will be the first phase of a billion-dollar waterfront restoration project in Hoboken. 

The new owner hopes to have the floating restaurant open by Labor Day.

“I loved the boat and I met a lot of nice people there,” said Mastronardi. “But Costa loves it too. It’s going to have a good home.”

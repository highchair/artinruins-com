### Reason for Demolition

“Building A” as it is known on the campus maps for the Miriam Hospital is the oldest building in the complex. Indeed, it is the original building from which Miriam grew. Built in 1921 as an orphanage, the building faded from use until the hospital moved across town in 1950.

Promotional materials list the build date as 1926, which might be more accurate (a secondary source shown below says 1921). The building deficiencies are listed as: Building envelope is deteriorating; waste and water piping is deteriorating; doorways and spaces need to meet ADA codes; HVAC systems are outdated, require frequent and costly repairs, and are energy inefficient; windows are outdated, leak, and energy inefficient.

[Their material goes on to say](https://www.brownhealth.org/locations/miriam-hospital/about-miriam-hospital/miriam-hospital-renovation-project) the project will be completed in phases so that there is minimal disruption to existing operations and care of patients. Phase 1 will include removing Building A and replacing it with a new building that includes a basement, three above grade stories and a rooftop penthouse for mechanical equipment. A redesigned Emergency Department will occupy the first floor and single patient rooms will occupy the second and third levels of the new building. The main entrance along Summit Avenue will also undergo a renovation.

Their centennial materials emphasize and increased demand for their services due to an aging population and extended lifespans from preventative procedures.


### Current Events

[The Miriam Hospital is celebrating its 100 year anniversary](https://www.miriam100.org/) with a fundraising campaign.

Demolition preparations are underway in the summer of 2025 and mark the start of a three year phased plan.


### History

_From “Providence: A Citywide Survey of Historic Resources,” prepared by the RIHPHC, 1986_

164 Summit Avenue — Jewish Orphanage, now **Miriam Hospital** 1921, 1950-52, 1964-67, 1975: Barker & Turoff, architects. A complex of 2-to 4-story, brick and concrete, flat-roof, simple, modernist buildings. An outgrowth of Miriam Lodge Number 13, Order of Brith Abraham, the Miriam Hospital Association was established in 1907 “for the purpose of building, maintaining, and operating a Hebrew Hospital.” The Association’s efforts at fundraising reached fruition in November 1925 with the purchase of a brick row house at [31-41 Parade Street]({% link _property/old-miriam-hospital.md %}) (q.v.). By the mid l940s, the Parade Street building proved too small for the growing hospital, and in 1945 the hospital bought the no-longer-used Jewish Orphanage on this 2 1/2 acre parcel. The abandoned building was remodeled and expanded with a large wing built between 1950 and 1952, when the hospital moved to this location. The hospital expanded with the construction of a large addition in the 1960s, and a new Intensive Care Unit was completed in the 1970s. Since 1969, Miriam has been associated with the medical program at Brown University. Still sponsored by individuals and organizations in the greater Providence Jewish community, Miriam Hospital is open to all.


### In the News

#### Miriam Hospital opens time capsule from nearly 75 years ago

**NBC 10 News** | June 19th 2025 

Miriam Hospital officials opened a time capsule that was sealed nearly 75 years ago.

According to hospital officials, the time capsule was placed into the cornerstone of its second building, formerly the Jewish Orphanage of Rhode Island.

“In 1950 a cornerstone was laid right here, marking a new chapter in Miriam Hospital’s growth. Today, as we open that capsule, we don’t just look back, but we connect across generations,” Miriam Hospital President Maria Ducharme said.

The time capsule contained items such as newspapers, a benediction document and dimes from the 1950s.

Jeffrey G. Brier, who served as chairman of the Miriam Hospital from 2004 to 2008, helped reveal the contents of the capsule.

He is the grandson of the then-board president who helped placed the cornerstone and the time capsule, according to hospital officials.

Ducharme said the time capsule opening also marks the official start to the demolition of Miriam Hospital campus' oldest building. 

She said it will be rebuilt with a new emergency department and new patient rooms.

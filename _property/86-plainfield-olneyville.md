### Reason for Demolition

According to [the Facebook page for Olneyville Tires](//www.facebook.com/olneyvilletire){:target="_blank"}, the Olneyville Tire Shop was started by the Elman family in 1923. The earliest mention of an Elman as owner — Arnold Elman — is from the 1962  Polk’s Providence City Directory.[^1] Norman Elman was later named in the incorporation papers from 1974.[^2]

There seems to be more story here, as the owner of the Facebook page slams Sabina Mattos for being proud of demolishing the location of a small business. We could not find press about the proceedings that led to the demolition. If anyone can point us in the right direction, please leave some notes in the comments.

Demolition occured on January 6, 2021 according to [video captured at the scene from Sabina Mattos’ Facebook page](//www.facebook.com/745078688/videos/10159597586478689/){:target="_blank"}.

### Current Events

The lot is still empty and undeveloped.


### History

No formal history found. Here are some mentions, though: 

+ [Photo on Instagram of the demolition](//www.instagram.com/p/CJrF0_7nCnr/){:target="_blank"} from @OlneyvilleSystem
+ _From a Real Estate listing circa 2007:_ As Exclusive Agents we are pleased to offer this outstanding business and real estate opportunity. Our client’s very profitable new and used tire business has been in his family and operated at the same location for 87 years. The owner is retiring and also selling the 3,280 Square foot building with 25 foot ceilings and 3 bay doors. This excellent business and property is located on a heavily trafficked street in the revitalized Olneyville section of Providence. The tire business, with a solid record of profits, presently has an inventory valued at $95,000.00. Owner also holds a used car sales license. Asking price for this business and real estate is a reasonable $450,000.00. — Captured 02 August 2023 from http://www.riequities.com/userFiles/Listings/documents/OlneyvilleTire.pdf

#### Maps

The earliest we could find this building was on one of the earliest maps we have access to. While it is on an 1889 map, it is likely older but we are unsure how much older.

+ [1889 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 1, Plate 27a](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099188901){:target="_blank"} (page 55) — On the corner of (what was then) Windsor and Plainfield Streets is number 40 and 42, a wood frame structure of mostly three stories with a Windsor Street first-story-facing outcropping and then a Plainfield Street one-story ground floor section. The postal addresses are 40 and 42.
+ [1900 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 3, Plate 264](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099190003){:target="_blank"} (page 54) — On the corner of Atwood (formerly Windsor) and Plainfield Streets is the same structure. Labelled three and one half stories instead of three, it has similar ground-floor outcroppings and interior walls on the drawing may indicate the three different postal units: 86, 88, and 90.

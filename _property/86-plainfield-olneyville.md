### Reason for Demolition

According to [the Facebook page for Olneyville Tires](//www.facebook.com/olneyvilletire){:target="_blank"}, the Olneyville Tire Shop was started by the Elman family in 1923. The earliest mention of an Elman as owner — Arnold Elman — is from the 1962  Polk’s Providence City Directory.[^1] Norman Elman was later named in the incorporation papers from 1974.[^2]

There seems to be more story here, as the owner of the Facebook page slams Sabina Mattos for being proud of demolishing the location of a small business. We could not find press about the proceedings that led to the demolition. If anyone can point us in the right direction, please leave some notes in the comments.

Demolition occured on January 6, 2021 according to [video captured at the scene from Sabina Mattos’ Facebook page](//www.facebook.com/745078688/videos/10159597586478689/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Research by Ian O’Connor, August 2023

The earliest mention of the site as we know it dates back to August 30, 1889 in _The Olneyville Times_ advertising that a man named William Charlesworth had been hired by the grocer George W. Amison at 40 Plainfield Street.[^2] At the time the address was listed as 40-44 Plainfield Street Johnston, RI, and would remain so until 1898 when the boundaries between Johnston and Providence shifted and the rest of Olneyville was incorporated into the city.

[^2]: “The Olneyville Times.” (Olneyville [Providence, R.I.]) 1887-1917, August 30, 1889, Image 3. Captured August 2023 from https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92064044/1889-08-30/ed-1/seq-3/

Amison’s grocery store appears to have done quite well with _The Olneyville Times_ reporting in January 24, 1890 that the business had grown steadily over the past 7 months and that Amison had taken over the adjacent storefront to expand his business.[^3]

[^3]: “The Olneyville Times.” (Olneyville [Providence, R.I.]) 1887-1917, January 17, 1890, Image 3. Captured August 2023 from https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92064044/1890-01-17/ed-1/seq-3/

The store became a fixture in the community for decades with ads appearing in _The Olneyville Times_ from 1890-1916. It appears that George Amison sold the business in the late 1910s or early 1920s.[^4] The ground floor of the building remained a grocery store until 1952[^5] but it changed hands multiple times and shrank in size to accommodate new businesses.

[^4]: The last mention of G.W. Amison’s market appears in an advertisement for “Clark’s Rheumatic Medicine,” The Olneyville Times, 1916. Captured August 2023 from https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92064044/1916-06-30/ed-1/seq-4/

[^5]: “The Providence Directory and Rhode Island State Business Directory.” Sampson & Murdoch Company, 1930. Reads as follows: 86 - Grocery Store run by John H. Gill (presumably husband of Eunice); 88 Eunice Gill (telephone operator); 90 - Restaurant run by Mrs Irene C Hyman (no name listed).

These included a small restaurant in the 1920s to provide the residents of Olneyville with hot meals. However, the restaurant also seems to have served as a speakeasy during prohibition and was raided by federal agents in 1922 for serving illegal liquor. By 1954, the ground floor space was occupied by the American Beef Company and Plainfield Street Shoe Repair along with a discount furniture business.

It should also be noted that the upper floors of the building were occupied by two or three small apartments. These units were home to a hairdresser, a teamsters, and even a switchboard operator among other tenants who called 86-90 Plainfield Street home over the years. Rents were relatively modest at $11 a month for a 5 room unit in 1930 according to an ad in the Providence Journal.[^6]

[^6]: The Providence Journal 30 November 1930. Classified ad offering a 5 room apartment for $11/month. “Apply at Stanley’s Market.”

Finally, in 1959, Olneyville Tire moved into the building from its former location next door at 77 Plainfield Street.[^7] The business had been supplying tires to Olneyville motorists since 1923 and needed to expand its operations to meet the postwar demand for tires. The owner of Olneyville Auto and Tire, Arnold Elman, purchased 86-90 Plainfield and added a new three bay garage sometime in the 1960s to accommodate their auto repair business. Norman Elman was later named in the incorporation papers from 1974 and appears to have run the business until his passing in 2015.[^8]

It appears that in 2019 the building was cited by the City of Providence’s Department of Inspection and Standards for unsafe conditions and later condemned. A lien was placed on the property in January of 2020 and on January 5, 2021 the building was torn down. As of today, it appears that the property is still owned by the Elman family.

#### Maps

The building appears on an 1889 map in the most recent shape and size. The building is not present on an 1875 map, but rather, there is a property labelled “Budlong” in its place.

+ [1875 Volume 2, Plate AA](//t93c12bb2a2098924.starter1ua.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_f7ee96de-6389-44f0-8032-5f233b336f51/){:target="_blank"} — At the corner of Plainfield and Windsor Streets is a property labelled “Budlong,” a house that was previously located here. It was presumably torn down after the death of its owner, Ms.Huldah Budlong, in 1882[^1] to make way for the new building which better fit the bustling commercial district of Olneyville Square.
+ [1889 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 1, Plate 27a](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099188901){:target="_blank"} (page 55) — On the corner of (what was then) Windsor and Plainfield Streets is number 40 and 42, a wood frame structure of mostly three stories with a Windsor Street first-story-facing outcropping and then a Plainfield Street one-story ground floor section. The postal addresses are 40 and 42.
+ [1900 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume 3, Plate 264](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3774pm.g3774pm_g08099190003){:target="_blank"} (page 54) — On the corner of Atwood (formerly Windsor) and Plainfield Streets is the same structure. Labelled three and one half stories instead of three, it has similar ground-floor outcroppings and interior walls on the drawing may indicate the three different postal units: 86, 88, and 90.

[^1]: An obituary for Huldah Budlong (3/1/1798 to 9/10/1882) in the Providence Evening Bulletin mentions that the funeral will progress from her “late residence, corner of Plainfield and Winston Streets, Olneyville” which would have been 86-90 Plainfield St. [A page on Family Search for Huldah Budlong](//ancestors.familysearch.org/en/MKT4-DXL/huldah-budlong-1798-1882) corroborates that she died in Sept of 1882. Based on her passing and the shift in footprint, it seems that the Budlong home was likely torn down sometime between 1882-1889.

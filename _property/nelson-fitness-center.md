### The Building

In 2001, Brown University demolished the [Marvel Gymnasium]({% link _property/brown-marvel-gym.md %}), a facility they closed in 1989. Located across from the Brown University football stadium, both facilities were far (for students) from the main campus.

In 2008, the [Smith Swim Center]({% link _property/smith-swim-center.md %}) was demolished and the site began to be prepared for this new facility. The building was the main swim center for the school, and the new building had to include an upgraded swimming facility.

We mention these two buildings because it seems that Brown used the site of one to build a modern interpretation of the other. The classicism of the former Marvel Gym can be seen in the symmetrical façades, round-arch and multi-pane windows, and cupola. In fact, the cupola is the renovated and refurbished cupola that was saved from the 1927 Marvel gym.

The facility features a 10,000 square feet filled with exercise machines, studios, offices for coaches and staff, varsity locker rooms, general use locker rooms, and social space.

The Nelson Fitness Center is one part of a 39-acre Ittleson Quadrangle, which includes:
+ Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center (adjacent to the Nelson Fitness Center)
+ Zucconi Strength & Conditioning Center (adjacent to the aquatics center)
+ George V. Meehan Auditorium
+ Paul Bailey Pizzitola Memorial Sports Center
+ Olney-Margolies Athletic Center (OMAC), which featured a rooftop soccer field
+ Two soccer fields, a lacrosse field, two football fields, a baseball stadium, softball field, and eight tennis courts

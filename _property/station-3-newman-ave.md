### Redevelopment

Plans to replace the 70-year-old-at-the-time station began in 1994.[^1] The station was deemed too small and new fire equipment would not continue to fit through its doors.

The new station at North Broadway and Greenwood Avenue — only a few blocks away but a very different address — now houses Engine Company 3, Ladder Company 3, and Hazmat 1. At the end of June, 2002, the City awarded a $2 million contract to DePasquale Building and Realty Co. of Johnston to construct the station. It was completed in 2002.[^2]

Station 1, built at the same time as #3 and sharing the same architectural style, was saved from closing and continues to operate today (in 2022).


### Current Events

This former Station 3 is now a private residence. 


### History

Two fire stations were built for East Providence in 1931 — this one, Station 3, and [Station 1 at 913 Broadway](//www.google.com/maps/place/913+Broadway,+East+Providence,+RI+02914/@41.8160824,-71.3695773,3a,75y,297.18h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sWvTon_uAaOT7Yp8IzezAwg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DWvTon_uAaOT7Yp8IzezAwg%26cb_client%3Dsearch.gws-prod.gps%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D280.0338%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e45ac62281587b:0xa22c4f43a51f5e36!8m2!3d41.8161355!4d-71.3699706?hl=en-US){:target="_blank"}. Both have the same architectural pattern and ornament consisting of a symmetrical design, row of arch-topped garage doors on the first floor, a row of rectangular windows across the second floor with a triple-group in the middle, topped with a stepped stone cornice. Ornament includes a stone band between floors and a cornice decorated with groups of five relief cast stone columns. Vertical quoins and brickwork top the windows with keystone-style elements at the center of the arches above the garage doors. 

Each are handsome early-mid-century stations. The Broadway station has been expanded and remains in service while this smaller, mostly square plan station has been converted to a residence.

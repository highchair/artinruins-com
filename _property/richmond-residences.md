### Proposal

Richmond Residences is an odd shaped new building partially next to and partially on top of neighboring old buildings. The design is another example of Truth Box Architect’s mission in action — to use the odd, leftover, strangely shaped pieces of land that no one else would.

The developer, Eli N. Schwartz, also owns the two buildings at 71–73 and 81–85 Richmond Street. The plans call for 10 residential units and six-stories of new construction sitting partially on top of an existing building over the original columns and walls. The apartments range in size from a six studios, three 1-bedrooms, and one 2-bedroom unit. The entrances and elevator shaft are squeezed between 81–85 Richmond and a building at 127 Friendship Street.

The designs went before the Design Review Committee (<span class="abbr">DRC</span>) in the fall of 2021 and was changed a few times to align with feedback. The overall aesthetic of the exterior glazing and contrast to the existing buildings were at issue. No Development Incentives was sought for this project, and no on-site parking was proposed.


### Design Reception

ArtInRuins supports density and also supports buildings that use odd, leftover spaces that are difficult to develop. The design of the building and the aesthetics don’t blend into their surroundings, but we don’t always think new construction can or should. Let the new be new, and let the old be old. The contrast is inherent.

A local architecture critic that we don’t always agree with thinks this building is “the wrong building in the wrong place.”[^1] His article was responding to the first set of renderings presented at the September 2021 <span class="abbr">DRC</span> meeting. We are pretty sure that he wouldn’t like the final renderings, either.

One thing we can agree with Mr. Morgan on is wondering what kind of person wants to live steps away from two nightclubs? Two a.m. Saturday nights are going to be loud and we hope the wall and window construction is built to keep the street noise out.


### History

_Both nearby buildings are listed in the Downtown Providence Historic District:_

71-73 Richmond Street — Commercial Building (ca. 1924-1926): A square, three-story, five-bay, flat roofed, brick building with a decorative concrete beltcourse that visually divides the first floor from the second. The large storefront windows on the first floor have been boarded over with a small section exposed at the top, over which hang cloth awnings. The second and third floors have groups of four windows in each bay. Above the first floor entrance is a single window with a decorative concrete lintel. A concrete cornice, integrated with the third floor lintels, underlines. four, evenly-spaced, decorative concrete medallions on the parapet. (The current home of Kulture Night Club.)

81-85 Richmond Street — Commercial Building (ca. 1889-1899): A small, rectangular, three-story, two-by-three bay, flat-roofed, brick building. The third story of the building is set back from the plane of the first and second story exterior walls. Fenestration of the building consists of aluminum sash, Chicago windows with cast, concrete sills, and keystone-ornamented lintels. There are three entrances to the building: one on the Friendship Street elevation and two on the Richmond Street elevation. All entrances consist of modern doors: either glass with an aluminum frame, or patterned steel. A band of soldier-coursed brick and a decorative concrete beltcourse just above visually divide the first floor from the second. (On the corner of Friendship and Richmond, ground floor restaurant in the existing space.)

### Redevelopment

While we can’t be sure until we see some photographic evidence, this is likely a great example of the [mid-century “New Look” Phillips 66 Gas Station design](//sca-roadside.org/vanishing-points-phillips-postwar-new-look-service-stations/){:target="_blank"}. Though the design idea of a canopy was not new[^1], Phillips new “swept-wing” design was a revolution at the time. 

[^1]: Frank Lloyd Wright is credited with the first canopy over gas pumps design, see the [R. W. Lindholm Service Station in Minnesota](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._W._Lindholm_Service_Station){:target="_blank"}

Cliff Leppke, author of a <abbr title="Society for Commercial Architecture">SCA</abbr> Journal article, _Vanishing Points: Phillips’ Postwar “New Look” Service Stations_, produced a video as part of his conference paper presentation. In it he describes the design concept this way: 

> Meant to catch the motorist’s eye, Phillips’ jet-age roadside architecture was part of the firm’s 1959 corporate identity makeover.[^2]

In more recent years, the former gas station was a tire shop. We are not sure when the gas pumps were removed. It was on the market to purchase in 2001 for around $200,000. In 2005-2006 the building was purchased, cleaned up, painted and was a breakfast and lunch place with smoothies and salads called **Jac’s Wraps**. They had the most giant armchairs in there, and the food was pretty good bu the vibe was sort of strange. They lasted for about 5 years.


### Current Events

This building is currently home to a convenience store with take away prepared food.

### Redevelopment

This adorably stout former fire house has had short periods of its life without occupants, but generally quite a history of tenants. Built right after the Civil War (April 12, 1861 to April 9, 1865), the building served as a firehouse for the Niagara company. The Niagara company started as a volunteer company but became paid city employees. 

The fire company occupied and used this facility up until around 1950, when it shows as vacant in a Sanborn Map.[^1] By the 1956 map, though, the building is labelled with an “S” for store.[^2] By then it was converted to commercial use. This is likely around the same time that the first floor façade on the western side was rebuilt and modified.

From 1983 to about 1990 the building was home to **Computopia**.[^3] The 1988 photo shows those signs on the firehouse. It was then converted to a food store called **Firehouse Food Store** starting in 1994.[^4] We are unsure how long this business lasted.

By 1998 **Miko’s**, a sex-positive adult store, moved in.[^5] They lasted almost 10 years at this corner, moving across town by 2007. Sometime before 2002 the property was part of a Ten Most Endangered List, heralded by the [Providence Preservation Society](//:ppsri.org){:target="_blank"}. We say that because in a 2002 news story it was mentioned as a success story, where highlighting the building led to new investment in it. It was likely listed before Miko moved in.

After Miko’s moved out, the building was vacant from 2008 to 2011. Google Streetview shows activity converting it to the current tenant in 2012. 


### Current Events

[Jerry’s Art-a-rama](//www.jerrysartarama.com){:target="_blank"} moved early in 2012 from the former [Vesta Knitting Mills]({% link _property/vesta-knitting-imperial-knife.md %}) in the Jewelry District and has been there since. 


### History

_From firefighter historian Henry Cahoon_

Members of this company became involved in fisticuffs with other companies and a civilian in 1853 whilst the Arnold Block burned. Behavior like this was not uncommon, but this finally led to the city taking control of the fire companies and forming the country’s second paid fire department. 

[FireNews](http://www.firenews.org/ri/p/providence/providenceri.html){:target="_blank"} lists this retired station as #17.

_From the National Register Nomination form for the Doyle Avenue Historic District, 1990, prepared by Amy S. Jordan_

653 North Main Street **Niagara Engine Company #5** (1867). A 2-story, stone-trimmed brick structure with a slate deck-on-hip roof. The first story was partly rebuilt in the 1960s with a modern storefront in place of an earlier one. This storefront, set off from the upper story by a cast-stone lintel, has a central entrance recess and large vertical-mullioned display windows on the front and part of each side. Above the lintel is a Gothic arch marking the location of an original central doorway surmounted by a single arched doorway on the first floor and a tripartite arched window on the second floor. The building is trimmed with a rusticated granite base and a brownstone beltcourse. The window and doorway arches are composed of alternating granite and brownstone radiating voussoirs. Heavy wooden brackets support the eaves. On the north side of the structure is a 3-story hose-drying tower, also of brick and topped by stone and brick corbels supporting a squat, slate, deck-on-hip roof. 

One of the earliest structures built during the city’s post-Civil War municipal improvements campaign, this was one of four new engine houses built to accommodate the change from hand-engines to steam power.

The Butler Exchange is the **400th property** to be documented for ArtInRuins! Added September 17, 2024.
{:.o__tldr}

### Reason for Demolition

The former Butler Exchange building was a central commercial structure in Downtown Providence. Most of Downtown at the time was still full of small, wooden and brick residences with ground-floor commercial operations.[^3] The building predates City Hall (cornerstone laid 1874) and larger multi-tenant buildings like the first Industrial Trust building (9 stories, 1893), the Banigan building (10 stories, 1896), the Turk’s Head Building (16 stories, 1913), and the [Hospital Trust Building]({% link _property/hospital-trust-no2.md %}) (11 stories, 1919).

[^3]: “Butler Exchange // 1871-1925.” Buildings of New England. Accessed 15 September 2024 from https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/03/21/butler-exchange-1871-1925/

Cyrus Butler’s heirs decided to construct a new building across the street from the Westminster-side of his [Arcade]({% link _property/arcade.md %}). One side would face Exchange Place (later Kennedy Plaza), making Butler Exchange one of the more photographed buildings of the time. At its completion, it was the largest building in Providence.[^4] Its style might have inspired the design of City Hall, though the designer, [Samuel J. F. Thayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_J._F._Thayer), also had a penchant for the French-style “mansard” roof design. “Second Empire,” as it came to be known, was very popular at the time.

[^4]: Ibid.

The building was 6 stories in total, and Sanborn Insurance Maps detail its construction of iron posts and iron storefronts on the first floor, with three stories of brick and two stories of a french roof.[^6] From the [photo of construction](#photo-butler-exchange-ppl-1872-01), it looks like the 5th and 6th floors were wood-framed. It suffered a massive fire in 1925 and was demolished. In its place rose the Art Deco 26-story [Industrial Trust building]({% link _property/industrial-trust-superman-bldg.md %}).

### History

#### Architect

[Lost New England](https://lostnewengland.com/2016/12/butler-exchange-providence-ri/) states the architect of Butler Exchange was [Arthur Gilman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Gilman), a designer who is credited with the Equitable Life Building in New York City. While we certainly think this is possible, Mr. Gilman’s work was largely centered around Boston and New York City, where he lived for a time. We have not found any other references to verify this claim. Much like Samuel J. F. Thayer, Mr. Gilman also had many Second Empire-style buildings in his portfolio and favored the mansard roof at this time in his career.

#### Bryant University

The Butler Exchange building was an integral part of the history of Bryant University. In 1863, “Bryant and Stratton National Business College” opened a campus in Providence.[^1] In parallel, the RI Commercial School started at Butler Exchange in 1900 and expanded on the fifth and sixth floors. It’s name would be emblazoned across the facade, as seen in [the 1915 postcard](#photo-butler-exchange-ppl-c1915-01).

[^1]: “Timeline of Providence, Rhode Island.” Wikipedia. Accessed 15 September 2024 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Providence,_Rhode_Island

Both schools quickly grew in these early years. Harry Loeb Jacobs, principal of the RI Commercial School, purchased Bryant and Stratton in 1916 and merged the two. The sign across the fifth floor roofline at Butler Exchange would become “Bryant & Stratton R. I. Commercial School.” The school would continue to grant bachelor of commercial science and bachelor of accounting degrees.[^2]

#### Providence Public Library

> The Library first opened its doors to the public in February 1878. It was located on the second floor of the Butler Exchange in what is now Kennedy Plaza. In two short years, larger quarters were secured on Snow Street between Westminster and Washington Streets.[^5]

#### The Start of the Triocchi Sisters Business

_From a [history of the Tirocchi Sisters](http://tirocchi.stg.brown.edu/514/story/business_butler.html), hosted by Brown University_

Anna and Laura Tirocchi arrived in Providence in 1907 and one or both may have worked for a time for a popular dressmaker on the city’s fashionable East Side. The Providence City Directory indicates that by 1911, they had opened a business in the Butler Exchange on Westminster Street in the heart of downtown Providence.

Butler Exchange was in the center of Providence’s commercial, financial, and legal district. The sisters shared the building with lawyers, doctors, dentists, and other professionals. Wholesalers, insurance agents, music teachers, the Republican State Committee, the Rhode Island Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and the Rhode Island Sunday School Association were also among the tenants of that building. In 1913, a firm of patent attorneys and the Crown Gold Mining & Milling Company of Nova Scotia flanked the Tirocchi Gown Suite on the fourth floor. The fifth and sixth floors were given over largely to music teachers.

As self-designated “gown makers,” Anna and Laura sought to distinguish themselves from others who were simply identified as dressmakers. Directly across the street, in the Arcade Building, twenty-five milliners and five dressmakers had shops. Other dressmakers and tailors for ladies were scattered throughout the center of the city. The prime location of the Tirocchi shop and the fact that they employed as many as twelve girls and women attested to their early prominence in the trade.

The Butler Exchange must have been a convenient downtown location for the Tirocchis’ clientele. With so many music teachers in the building, the affluent women of Providence may have come to the building often with their children in tow. The aforementioned quarters of the Republican State Committee — in which a high number of Tirocchi clients were involved, Temperance Union, and Sunday School Association would likely have drawn some of them, too. General business and shopping also drew them downtown.

Anna would have been in her mid-thirties, with twenty years of experience in her trade, when she opened the downtown shop. Laura was thirteen years younger than Anna, but had also been trained in Italy. The sisters were well qualified to operate a high-end custom dressmaking shop, and their Roman pedigree lent them a certain European chic that their American competitors couldn’t claim.

About 50% of the sisters’ business involved the traditional work of a dressmaker–altering, making over, repairing, cleaning, and pressing garments for their clients. The remaining 50% came from making gowns using fabric and ideas provided by the client or inspired by French fashion. Anna also designed original gowns for her clients and found this custom work the most satisfying. In these early years, the Tirocchis built a loyal following among Providence women who could afford their services.

—

The sisters later moved to [514 Broadway, known as the Wedding Cake House]({% link _property/kendrick-prentice-tirocchi-house.md %}), in 1915.

#### Other Former Tenants

The list of tenants is very long, as the building was six stories and covered an entire city block. Addresses in an 1889 map included 34–38 (even and odd numbers) Exchange Place and 97–105 (odd numbers only) Westminster Street, while the 1899 map listed 56–64 Exchange Place and 117–131 Westminster Street. So, depending on what year you are looking, the numbers to look for are different.

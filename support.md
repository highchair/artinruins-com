ArtInRuins is a labor of love. We are not a huge organization, we are not a giant team of volunteers, we are only a few people willing to spend the time to do the research and take the photos and design and support the website. We love what <abbr title="ArtInRuins">A.I.R.</abbr> has become and want to see it continue. That being said, <abbr title="ArtInRuins">A.I.R.</abbr> can only be updated in our “spare” time, and it does cost real money from time to time. So, here are some ways that you can help.

## Donate Money

{% include paypal.html %}

**If money were no object we wouldn’t be asking for it**{: .u__text__sans--bold.u__color__primary }. Far from being compensated for our time, our only wish is that <abbr title="ArtInRuins">A.I.R.</abbr> could sustain itself and it’s yearly expenses — domain name ownership and server/hosting fees. Here’s where you come in: if you like what you see, and you have an extra few bucks, send them our way. _Why?_ Do it for the joy of helping your fellow history nerds, or do it because it will make your mom mad, or heck, do it because you want to. Any amount helps out, and thanks. 

_Note:_ AIR is not – nor can we afford to become – a registered 501c3 non-profit. Please remember that your contribution is not tax-deductible, but our love will keep you warm at night. 


## Send me a Gift

This is not why I do it… but it you really like ArtInRuins, I have a gift list on Amazon with some local resources, photography-related items, and some graphic design things as well. If you are so inclined, something from this list would be fantastic. AND if you can get the same thing while supporting a local bookstore or shop, please do that and I'll remove the item from [my public wish list](//www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2NUTLG5EDL7U8/ref=cm_wl_huc_view){:target="_blank"}.


## Donate Time and/or Expertise

The history we collect here is typically cut-and-pasted from work other people have done – we won’t pretend that it isn’t. And yet, some of it is new and done for the first time. Some of it is current events and it takes keeping our ears on the ground, picking up new info, riding by to see what is going on, or getting tips from fellow <strike>snoops</strike> historians like you.

Help us grow ArtInRuins and our collection of buildings. Contribute your expertise about a building, or, [contact us]({{ '/' | relative_url }}contact) for a to do list of properties that we’d like more info on before we build a page for it.

<div class="o__tldr">
  <p><abbr title="Too Long; Didn’t Read">TL;DR</abbr>: These things are long, we get it. Here's what you need to know. We only use Google Analytics to track usage of the site, and the tool does a good job of keeping that data anonymous. BUT, that service could change and we might now know about it. It might be collecting data that we do not get access to and do not know about. So, there’s that. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not knowingly collect or store personal information without your consent</li>
    <li>We do not sell your information to any 3rd parties</li>
    <li>You may opt out of cookies and it will not affect the function of the site</li>
    <li>You may request to have your submitted anecdotes deleted if you so choose</li>
  </ul>

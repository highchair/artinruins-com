### Reason for Demolition

The buildings came down in March, 2011. They were not under Industrial Commercial Buildings District (ICBD) protection, or any other, for that matter. Though the earlier half of the two appears as a contributing structure in the [Jewelry Manufacturing Historic District]({% link list/providence-jewelry-manufacturing-historic-district.html %}). The owner applied for all the necessary permits and were granted them. It was believed that Brown University was behind this occurrence, but nothing ever came of that rumor. The owner’s – G+K Realty Co, 85 South Street – are land-banking the property until the “Knowledge District” makes the land more valuable. Then who knows. Maybe it is the owner’s intent to sell it to Brown at a premium once the land is cleaned up and remediated. 

Unfortunately, a familiar story happened – there are only plans for a surface parking lot and a “hole” in the streetscape for the time being. As the former building and land under it soaked up plating chemicals for the past 80+ years, there must have been some serious underground contamination issues to be dealt with (and a parking lot is the cheapest way to encapsulate it). The plating process is very toxic, and the Regal Plating company had been doing it for at least 50 years. A new owner might have to foot the bill for proper remediation, we are not sure. 

The owner of the property sent ArtInRuins the real estate overview as a PDF. The asking price in 2011 was $3.2 million. Loopnet had a listing for this property as early as 2007. 

We love, love, loved the gothic font on that sign. Very nice example of 1950’s industrial lettering.


### Current Events

The site, sadly, nearly 10 years later, is still a parking lot. 


### History

Some records show that the Regal Plating Company was established in 1948 and employed up to 43 people. Their activities were Metal Finishing, Plating, Metal Polishing, Metalworking, Gold Plating, Silver Plating, Gold & Silver Plating, Metal, Polishing, Finishing, and Buffing. 

We **think** that the one story building east of the two story building was the Women’s City Missionary Society Laundry, built in 1903. The 2-story adjacent addition seems to show up in aerial photos after 1952, but it is hard to be sure. 


_Providence Jewelry Manufacturing Historic District nomination form, 1985_

Women’s City Missionary Society Laundry (1903): This is a single story, flat-roof,.brick building on a raised basement. Three bays
wide and six bays deep, it has a central front entrance that is sheltered by a large shed roof with elaborate brackets. There is also a side entrance with a large, projecting, gable-roof hood with built-up brackets. The windows in the upper story have brick jack arches and quarry-faced granite sills. The basement windows have quarry-faced sills and lintels. The roof, which was originally enclosed by a picket fence and used for drying laundry, has a copper-sheathed coping and projecting eaves with blocklike brackets. Except foT some replacement of the original six-over-six windows, the principal alteration has’ been the addition of a single-story, flat-roof, brick wing on the northeast corner, which contains a loading bay. The laundry is presently occupied by a manufacturer of plating equipment. _(A.I.R.: Remember, addresses change. The address for Women’s City Missionary Society Laundry was 155 Chestnut Street)_

_From the Jewelry District Association history page_

Not all of the building in this vicinity in the early 20th century was related to the jewelry industry. An interesting exception was the Providence Women's  City Missionary Society Laundry, built at 155 Clifford Street in 1903. The  Providence Women's City Missionary Society was a voluntary society founded in 1867 to aid the city's indigent women. A basic goal in their efforts was to  create an "industrial home" where women might learn skills that would enable  them to earn a living.  A lack of finances delayed the creation of such an institution until 1897, when the Society, following the example of Trinity Church, Boston, established a  laundry where needy women could find employment and learn the trade. The laundry's success enabled the Society to move it out of rented quarters and into  this new building, designed specifically as a laundry.

For several years the laundry was able to support itself, but in 1908, a depression reduced the amount of business at the same  time that large commercial laundries began to compete with hand-wash  laundries. By 1912, both business and the number of applicants for positions in the laundry had decreased to the extent that the Society closed the laundry and  sold the building. In the course of its existence, the laundry paid $42,000 to its employees, all of them needy women. The Society itself continued its other activities for many more years before publishing its final report in 1940. The  laundry building was soon taken over by the J. & H. Electric Company, a firm  that specialized in furnishing and servicing electrical motors and other  apparatus for the jewelry industry and other manufacturers. After J. & H.  Electric moved to anew building at 200 Richmond Street in 1929, the former laundry building was occupied by a succession of tenants, all involved in some aspect of the jewelry industry.

_From Providence’s North Burial Ground Women’s History Tour_

Sarah Durfee […] worked for more than forty years. An active member of Providence’s First Baptist Church, she served as president of the Women’s City Missionary Society, organized in March 1868, to “assist the poor in efforts to help themselves, and to engage in general missionary work for the city, providing homes for women who desire to reform, where they may be enabled to earn an honest livelihood, and aiding poor girls to procure respectable homes and employment.” Many women contributed money or visited the indigent who lived in their wards.

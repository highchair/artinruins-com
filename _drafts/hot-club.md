Yupping it up Chic to chic, The Hot Club is a cool place

_by Russell Garland_  
**Providence Journal** | October 27, 1985 (abridged)

Three years ago, the Hot Club was a decrepit brick shack perched beside the Providence River downwind of a fish company.

If a building ever lacked potential, that was it.

On warm nights it’s been hard to get in the place, even though owners have added a 164-foot waterside deck with an outdoor bar. Fast motorboats tie up alongside as bar patrons in cotton sweaters admire the arch-windowed power plant across the river and the lighted city skyline.

It’s definitely not Newport, but rather a kind of urban waterfront chic that has made the Hot Club — so named because it was once a factory boiler house — the hottest new club in the city.

Tom Bates says he never planned it that way.

“My concept was to have a nice little bar by the waterfront,” he said with a sly smile. “I think I failed.”

BATES’ HUGE success with what looked like a sure loss should come as no great surprise. Nearly 10 years ago, he bought a now legendary bar under an interstate highway: the Met Cafe.

The Met, scheduled to close this week, can still draw a crowd, but its rocking bands and free spirited atmosphere are from a different world than the Hot Club, City Lights and Sh-Booms, the places usually mentioned as the city’s most popular clubs. […]

About all the Hot Club has in common with the Met besides owners Tom Bates and Josh Miller is the ubiquitous presence of Rolling Rock beer in long neck bottles. Bates and Miller, a former partner in the Met, spent two years looking for a new bar site before they found what they wanted.

“We just thought the trend of the city was moving in this direction,” said Bates, a soft-spoken man with streaks of gray in his beard. “There was no [Corliss Landing]({% link _property/providence-steam-engine.md %}), there was no waterfront festival. We just took a chance.”

Bates, Miller and their partners, George Germon and Johanne Killeen, owners of Providence’s Al Forno restaurant, opened the Hot Club on April 15, 1983. The bar was one tiny room, smaller than the Met.

Bates’ “chance” just kept expanding, rolling on the same upscale wave that turned the factory the Hot Club used to heat into Corliss Landing condos. Hot Clubers’ cars crowd streets near the Fox Point hurricane barrier. On Friday afternoons, the cocktail hour crowd on the Hot Club deck is “awesome,” said City Lights’ Gootkind, his voice filled with admiration.

“I think the attraction is the water,” Bates said. “Water does what an open fire does for people. Even if it’s the Providence River.” […]

“I think the bars that attract people and make sense to me,” he said, “are places where people come in and just be themselves.”

Savory simplicity achieves renown
March 27, 1985 | Providence Journal (RI)

The two opened Al Forno, an intimate, dimly lit little restaurant, five years ago. Several years ago, they also opened The Hot Club, an "in" bar on the waterfront.

[Which puts the open date around 1978?]

Not all the 'light' beers are low in calories
August 31, 1983 | Providence Journal (RI) (excerpt)

The Hot Club, a tiny bar established in what used to be a boiler room, serves the hottest martinis in town. It's the Cajun martini: jalapeno peppers and the gin they've been marinated in. The martini is garnished with a strip of hot pepper.

Owners Johanne Killeen and George Germon, who also own Alforno restaurant, first tasted the Cajun martini at K-Paul's Louisana Kitchen in New Orleans. The Hot Club has a limited menu of snack food, such as chili dogs and grilled chicken kebabs, cooked over a wood fire. It's on the water, near R.I. Fish, at 575 S. Water St., Providence, just off Wickenden Street.

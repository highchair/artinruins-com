78 FOUNTAIN STREET
Diagonally across Fountain Street from the Residence Inn project, Cornish Associates has proposed a six-story apartment building with retail on the ground floor.
It would be built on what is now a parking lot bordered by Fountain, Washington, Mathewson and Clemence Streets, one corner of which is the site of a small two-story building that housed the former Coffee King restaurant.
The project, which would have 141 apartments and 17,000 square feet of retail space, has received approval from the city.
Arnold B. “Buff” Chace Jr., founder and managing partner of Cornish, said he is lining up construction financing and hopes work will begin this year.

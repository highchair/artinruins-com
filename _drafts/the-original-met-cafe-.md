#### CLOSING TIME They're playing the last waltz at the Met Cafe

_by Bob Kerr_  
**Providence Journal** | October 27, 1985 (abridged)

IT’S THE MIX that makes The Met.

The aging swashbuckler with geometrically perfect hair, the rheumy-eyed groveler, the theater patron looking to water down some cultural overload - all can dive into the dusty, sweaty social swarm of the Met Cafe and find a certain balance.

The Met is pure barroom, a survivor of the hanging fern and five-part cocktail. All by itself down below the highway on Friendship Street, with orange and green neon marking its place among weeds and blacktop, it is a place for things undiluted - the warm sting of whiskey, the ragged punch of rock 'n roll, the chance to meet a stranger without ritual.

At The Met, the most direct light shines on the pool table.

The house vintage is Rolling Rock in the long neck green bottles.

The bandstand is the size of a breakfast table and the curtain behind it the color of slush.

Behind the bar, there is a picture of Oil Can Boyd, a string of lost keys and bartenders who move fast or starve.

On the jukebox, there is Jimmy Rodgers, Kitty Wells, Bill Doggett, Waylon Jennings.

Some scattered tiles in the tin ceiling are scrubbed clean, making small white islands in a sea of deepening grime.

A biker once brought his new motorcycle to The Met to show it off. He wheeled it in.

A trumpet player from Swansea making his first visit was fascinated by the experience of standing at the urinal in the men's room and looking out the opened door to see a girl waving at him from the dance floor.

IT IS A SMALL, close place where the basics are well tended and the frills die. It is a place done in heavy earth tones, from nicotine brown to bourbon amber.

Bob Stewart found it when a cabdriver took him there in 1973, back before The Met got musical. He loved it then and he loved it later, for a lot of reasons. He remembers the great pinball machine, the roach races on the bar, the Met canoe race, the Met softball team and the woman who frequently came in during one hot summer and insisted on removing her clothes.

“It’s no frills, man, it’s a bar,” said Stewart, a former Providence Journal reporter now at the Los Angeles Times. “The drinks were always incredibly cheap but they always served top shelf whiskey.”

Stewart claims a piece of Met history. He took the picture that went on the Met t-shirt. It was taken out front, a setting that appears perfect for some down and dirty blues band to choose for an album cover. There were nude people in the picture. A RIPTA bus went by at the time and the passengers fairly steamed the windows with the hot breath of curiousity.

Now, the shirt is a collector’s item, a relic of sorts. There will be no more T-shirts because there will be more Met. It will be mourned by many who found it to be the best of bar, a place apart from frosted glass and smooth moves.

“THERE’S NOWHERE like it,” said Dennis McCarthy, the tall lean singer-songwriter of the Groovemasters, the house band if there is a house band. “For me it’s the closest place you can get to a honky tonk. People come here expecting to hear live music and drink a thousand beers.”

The Met can’t happen in another place, said McCarthy. There’s just no way to pick up and move all the memories and all the dust.

“You could build another place but for all intents and purposes it wouldn't be The Met.”

The lease that Tom Bates, the current owner of The Met, has with Johnson & Wales runs out this Thursday, Halloween night. It will not be renewed. Johnson & Wales wants the property for purposes college officials will not divulge. The Met's final closing is a day to day situation.

Bates, a RISD graduate, was working as a carpenter renovating houses when Josh Miller, who bought The Met with Tom Fairhcild in 1975, gave him a chance to buy into the bar business the following year. He is not fighting The Met's end. And he knows it can't be transplanted. He thinks times at the bar are changing and he's ready to change with them.

“I’m getting a lot of ‘don’t let it go,” said Bates. “But I just don’t see the sense in that.”

BATES GREW UP in upstate New York just outside of Utica, an area that for many sets the standard for the bar of clear purpose. Between Utica and Albany and Utica and Syracuse are bars that have been around for a while, offering the homegrown taste of Utica Club and Genesee Cream Ale. They are furnished in stuff that looks like somebody’s great grandmother’s front parlor furniture - old wood and faded mirrors cluttered with cards of pocket combs, jars of pickled eggs and boxes of Slim Jims. There is a shuffleboard, a pool table and a feeling that nothing much will ever change.

Bates thinks there might have been a bit of the flavor of upstate New York on Friendship Street.

“The bars that made sense to me are the ones that people can come into and be themselves,” said Bates.

The Met made sense, until now. But Bates thinks its time is over. The efforts by the hastily formed Met Cafe Preservation Society to save it are apparently too little too late despite the hundreds of names on the group’s petition on the wall.

“The days of going to a bar and getting blasted out of your tree are gone. People are more aware of drunk driving. They are getting into more interesting drinks, more juices, mineral waters.”

BATES NOW owns the Custom House, a quiet place downtown. He is also a partner in the Hot Club, a converted heating plant on the Providence River that might be as cramped as the Met but is a long way from its earthy intimacy.

“The concept is still the same,” he said. “The mix of people, a place to get together. There isn’t that much difference. But I’m not trying to transplant The Met.”

Back at The Met on a Wednesday night, the Groovemasters are playing one of their final sessions in the corner. The place is packed. There is no room for anyone else. Dozens more come in. Roving prepsters with collars flipped into formation dance up and down. A woman who appears fresh from Talbots clings to her husband who is in full Ralph Lauren on what is obviously their semi-annual night of wild abandon.

In the middle of the sweating, bouncing barroom stew, Stanley Jaksina and Freddie Watson stake out their patch of bartop and drink draft beers. The Met is their bar, when the music’s playing and when it’s not. Jaksina runs Richmond News down the street. Watson says he’s a dancer and a sax player and is now working as a chef.

“Three, four times a week I come in,” said Watson. “I came in about five, six o’clock, drink some beers. I walk here. There won’t be another place like this. There’ll only be one Met.”

Jaksina points to the picture of Davey Lopes hanging next to the swordfish that arches over one end of the bar.

“I hung that up there,” he said. “And did you see the Olympic picture outside? I hung that too.”

He is obviously proud of having a piece of the place. He thinks Tom Bates is the greatest saloonkeeper there is. But he doesn’t know where he’ll go now. Neither does Watson. The Hot Club isn’t their kind of place. They’ve got some time in grade at The Met. It’s their place. They go to another place and the beer just won’t taste the same.

# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)

// The load path '_sass' is assumed and inserted here for every include
// To change the load path, go to _config.yml and change the value of 'sass_dir'


// From https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/
// 
// Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
// Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
// Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
// Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
// Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
// Components – specific UI components. This is where the majority of our work takes place and our components are often composed of Objects
// Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class


// Our functions and helpers
@import '1_tools/index';
@import '2_settings/index';

// Output CSS now
@import '3_generic/index';

// This project
@import '4_elements/index';
@import '5_objects/index';
@import '6_components/index';
@import '7_templates/index';

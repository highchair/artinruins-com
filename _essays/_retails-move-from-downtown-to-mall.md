The purpose of the core of downtown Providence has shifted greatly over the years. In its earliest incarnations, downtown was the center of business-to-business commerce with shipping of goods moving through the ports and out to all four points of the compass. As the working middle class and businesses grew, downtown and its proximity to water bourne shipping lanes became less important. Shipping via rail and truck became cheaper and faster. 


## Downtown as a Retail Center


## The Inception

1981 at the Blue Point Oyster House on North Main Street, landscape architect and urban planner William Warner and his wife, Peggy, RISD teacher, painter and architect Irving Haynes, and Providence architect Friedrich St. Florian were having dinner. The wine was flowing and they generally were complaining to each other about the direction of City planning efforts when they started to think about the moon-shot. What would be the ideal reclamation of the City as a walkable, interesting and exciting urban center? 

Why had the City turned its back to the two rivers that converge near its center? People love the water… why is it covered up? Initial ideas were bounced around at the table, literally drawing on napkins, and that is where the idea for Waterplace Park was born. 

Amtrak was already planning to remove the “Chinese Wall” of elevated train tracks and move them underground with the new Train station on Gaspee Street (built 1984-86). They caught the ear of mayor Cianci and others in City planning, and the idea picked up momentum. This was the biggest catalyst of change and renewed development interest in the city, and it “only” took $1.5 billion in state, federal and private money to make it happen. 

Interestingly, Blue Point would be demolished because of the increased attractiveness in the mill next door after work on Capital Center was nearing completion. Pilgrim Mills was turned into residential condos around 1998, and the restaurant that bore the idea for Waterplace park and Capital Center suffered the consequences.

## 1992

The Capital Center project and the very costly and very large Waterplace redevelopment were nearing the end and stalled for a bad economy. Capital Center — The Convention center, the Westin, the Mall — were the last of the giant infrastructure projects for the time. 

Famed urbanist Andres Duany was talking about and proposing that redevelopment get small — block by block, floor by floor, one building at a time. And he was stressing historically sensitive urban redevelopment, not raze it all and build anew. His vision very much informed what Buff Chase and Cornish would start to do in the late 90s and early 2000s. 

The Convention Center and hotel would be finished by 1993. 

Downtown developers had a conundrum — People will not live downtown until downtown is more interesting, but it will not be more interesting until more people live downtown. The developments on the edge of Downtown in Capital Center were looked at as an anchor and the beginning of the density needed to make a revitalized Downtown work. If people are to live Downtown, they need destinations. They need density in the way of visitors staying in the city center, too. They need restaurants and nightlife to follow. 

Malls were a suburban phenomenon, for the most part. Urban malls worked when they were very big and drew very big brand names — the kind that would draw people and the kind that would be more comfortable on a busy city street than in a mall. The fate of a vibrant Downtown was linked in many people's minds to the fate of Capital Center and the new Mall. 

This was around the time that the Shepard building on Westminster Street was almost demolished. It was instead saved with investment from the city and the state in the form of funding but also a long term tenant from Rhode Island College. Johnson and Wales started to invest in new buildings in the downtown, and came forward to redevelop the former burned out Outlet company.

There was pushback on the mall plan, particularly among concerned citizens who didn't like the creative financing and the city's stake in the success of the mall. Taxes were deferred for as number of years and the direct benefit to the city was greatly reduced in favor instead of the City gaining on the butterfly effects of such a development. Taxpayers were rightly alarmed at how the mall was financed. 

Others thought that building a mall was like creating a Zoo around the last dinosaur. Malls were not fashionable anymore, and creating a car-centric structure was not going to be good for Downtown or the City n the long-term.

## 1990-1991

The construction of the mall meant the demolition of two large structures — The State Normal School, also called the Rhode Island College of Education, and the University of Rhode Island Providence branch. The state owned the land at the time. 

One of the smartest things that the City could have done was to convince URI to move their Providence branch downtown to the historic Shepard building which was purchased by someone who claimed the debt to be burdensome, and wanted to demolish it for a parking lot. Saving this beautiful historic structure in the heart of Downcity was key to the continued revitalization of the Downtown center. This all happened between 1990 and 1991.

## Aside about the Normal School

The first Rhode Island State Normal School, for teacher predatory and training, opened in May of 1854 as one of the nation's first. It started in the Second Universalist Church building on Weybosset Street and then moved to Bristol for a time before being brought back to Providence in 1871. 

The building that was torn down was built in 1900 and financed by the State. In 1920, it was renamed  the Rhode Island College of Education. By 1958, the college was moved to its current campus in the Mount Pleasant section of Providence. The downtown building shifted to become home to the state's Education Department.

## 1994-1996

Cianci was a big booster of the mall, and while Governor Almond ran his campaign against the mall in 1994, he slowly became a booster, too. 

The mall plan won approval from the City Council in 1996. The project had a $360 million budget at the time. The design team was Providence architect Friedrich St. Florian and ADD Inc. of Boston and was meant to represent a small city of its own, built up as different buildings over time that were eventually joined together.

## 1997

While excavating for the foundation of the mall, PAL (the Public Archeology Lab) found the remains of the former Rhode Island State Prison. The entire footprint of the prison, including the foundations of the solitary confinement cells, the warden's house and prison workshop could be seen. The site was heavily documented and the public was even invited to visit the site before construction continued. 

The prison operated from 1837 until the Adult Correctional Institutions were built in Cranston in 1877. It housed about 250 inmates, including the last prisoner to be executed in Rhode Island. It was demolished in 1894.

There was a previous design idea that was a monolith of a building… one which would have looked out of place near the State House and one which worried many people. The reaction was to build something that, in our opinion, looks a bit too much like the Las Vegas version of a city block. It is better than a suburban-inspired monolith? Perhaps, but in the end, it is still a mall and its own history is one of fabrication.

The mall started to be built in 1997.

It opened in 1999 and cost $460 million. It was close to one of the most expensive projects in the state, third only to two electric-generating facilities.

To a large degree, the investment in the mall worked. 

2002-2003	Jefferson Place (the 903)
2004		the Masonic Temple was reborn
2003-2004	the Foundry complex started to go residential
2005-2006	GTech
2005-2009	Park Row
2005-2007	a new Westin tower
2006-2007	Waterplace Towers

All of this happened a decade after the mall was built. 

As intended, the investment in Capital Center — the mall, Waterplace Park, the Westin, and the Convention Center — led to an increase in investment downtown, most on Westminster Street:

1992-1994	Johnson & Wales' new downtown campus on Weybosset St on the site of the Outlet Company
1997-2002	The Alice Building
1998–2004	The Fletcher Building by RISD
2002-2004	The Burgess & O'Gorman buildings
2003–2004	The Wilkinson Building, former Lerner Department store
2003-2005	Hotel Providence in the former Lederer Building
2004-2006	The former Peerless building

Demand for malls began to shift and "lifestyle centers" became a newer concept around 2005-2006. 

In 2002, Richard Askin, of the Cambridge, Mass., architecture firm ADD Inc, laid out the national development landscape.

"The next generation of retail development is being led by 'place-making' projects, where town centers are either created from existing urban cores, or built from scratch," Askin said when his firm was chosen to do design work on The Village at South County Commons, in South Kingstown.

Ironically, ADD was involved in creating the mall with local architects Frederick Florian.

Aside about Living in IKEA

In many ways, Michael Townsend's obsession with living in a mall predated a more widespread obsession with living at IKEA. Its a whole thing.

Meanwhile, the mall was very profitable, making the news in 2007.

The apartment at the mall was discovered in late 2007. 

Highchair had worked on the Tape Art project website in 2005. We were as surprised as anyone that they also around the same time were living at the mall. The Apple store came to the mall around 2006.

Historic districts across the nation offer limited protection for the structures they contain. In Providence, we have seen Historic Districts lose properties to fire, lack of maintenance and neglect, developer speculation, or just the forward march of progress.
{:.u__text__sans--bold.u__color__primary}

As the saying goes, “You don’t know what you had until it’s gone.” When one or two historic properties are removed from a neighborhood, we may not feel it immediately. But how many buildings need to be removed before a neighborhood (or city) loses its sense of identity?

</figure>

In Fox Point, residents are struggling with that question. In 2021, [an over 200-year-old colonial house]({% link _property/312-wickenden-st.md %}), which was the location of a restaurant called the Duck and Bunny, was hastily demolished by its owner. A demolition permit was granted mid-March and the building started to come down 2 weeks later. There was no local historic district protection for the building or demolition delay to notify neighbors and abutters of this action. Three years later, the lot is still empty.

Wickenden Street was also outside the jurisdiction of a demolition delay ordinance at the time.</figcaption>
</figure>

Later, in 2023, a proposal to demolish two structures for a new five-story apartment building at the [corner of Wickenden and Brook Streets]({% link _property/249-265-wickenden-st.md%}) came before the City Plan Commission (<span class="abbr">CPC</span>) for approval. The meeting was packed with neighbors and constituents opposed to the size and scale of the proposal within a relatively low-height but high-density neighborhood. Because the current buildings were listed as “non-contributing” in the College Hill Historic District, any new construction plans did not need the Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">HDC</span>) approval.

</figure>

The Fox Point neighborhood is exploring a new historic overlay district in 2024, gathering the signatures of residents within the boundary. According to Ward One Councilman John Goncalves, [the protection of a local historic district is the best way to save it’s historic look and feel](https://www.fpna.net/single-post/it-s-decision-time-for-the-fox-point-historic-district). Concerned residents agree as they hope to slow development and promote more resident involvement in proposals for demolitions and new construction.

But what does a historic district allow or restrict? How difficult is it to create a new district? As more communities explore the pros and cons of Historic Districts, it is important to understand the benefits, limitations, and flexibility that different kinds of districts may offer.

## What’s a Historic District?

A “Historic District” designation means there is a concentration of buildings, structures, objects, or other sites that are related either historically (tied to a particular person or event) or aesthetically (designed in a similar style or built at the same period). Examples include college campuses, large estates or farms, villages, and industrial complexes. Historic Districts have two forms: National and Local. 

### National Historic Districts (<span class="abbr">NHD</span>)

In 1966, the National Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places. This official list of properties documents those that are significant to the country’s history. The list is maintained by the National Park Service.

There are [more than 2,300 National Historic Districts](http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/workingonthepast/) across the United States with over [790 sites (individual properties or districts) located in Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Rhode_Island).

Wade</a> at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Street_Scene_Newport.jpg">Wikipedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Some Benefits

Inclusion in an <span class="abbr">NHD</span> offers some benefits, mostly related to income-producing properties (think of a hotel or mill conversion into apartments). They can access Federal tax credits to defray the cost of renovation or building upkeep. Another benefit is high property values — generally, buildings within a district command premiums over those that are not.

The Federal Housing Administration may offer loan programs with favorable terms for those seeking to purchase a home with historic significance if it means the property will be restored and maintained.

</figure>

#### No Protections
Contrary to popular belief, inclusion in a federally recognized <span class="abbr">NHD</span> like the [College Hill National Historic District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Hill_Historic_District_(Providence,_Rhode_Island)) does not protect the buildings within it from demolition.

In Providence, 28% of the City is within a designated National Historic District. Within many of the National districts are Local Historic Districts, though they represent a much smaller 7% of the city. (Both statistics taken from a recent PVD Eye story, “[Gentle Density: How to Have Both Preservation and Population Growth in Providence](https://pvdeye.org/gentle-density-how-to-have-both-preservation-and-population-growth-in-providence/)”)

</figure>

### Local Historic Districts (<span class="abbr">LHD</span>)

As the name implies, Local Historic Districts are managed by individual municipalities and local governments. In Rhode Island, the state legislature empowered cities and towns to adopt historic district zoning. Municipalities get support from state-level entities like the [Rhode Island Historic Preservation and Heritage Commission](https://preservation.ri.gov/) (<span class="abbr">RIHPHC</span>), but enact and enforce independently.

Enforcement of a <span class="abbr">LHD</span> is accomplished through a Historic District Commission (<span class="abbr">HDC</span>). In the City of Providence, districts are overseen by the [Providence Historic District Commission](https://www.providenceri.gov/planning/providence-historic-district-commission-phdc/) (<span class="abbr">PHDC</span>). The commission’s membership comprises no more than 12 citizens who must live in Providence and demonstrate an interest in historic preservation. 10 are appointed by the mayor and 2 are City Council members.

Unique to Rhode Island, in 2022 the General Assembly required training for planning boards, zoning boards, and members of <span class="abbr">HDC</span>s. All members, regardless of tenure, must receive a 3-hour introductory training course followed by a 1-hour refresher every year they serve. [R.I. Statewide Planning](https://planning.ri.gov/) convenes the Advisory Committee for Education to offer this training through the “Making Smart Land Use Decisions” course and through the [Commission Assistance and Mentoring Program](https://www.napcommissions.org/camp) led by the [National Alliance of Preservation Commissions](https://www.napcommissions.org/).

The <span class="abbr">PHDC</span> has one set of guidelines for all districts, but they are not required. Local districts can have more flexibility in what they can protect and regulate. One neighborhood representing an intact architectural style might have protections for important construction and design details, while another might focus more on the scale and massing of the neighborhood’s streetscape.

An example in Providence is the Providence Landmarks District, which follows two sets of guidelines: one for residential properties, and another for former industrial or commercial properties.

There are 8 designated Local Historic Districts in Providence, which overlap with some of the National Historic Districts. The <span class="abbr">PHDC</span> has [maps and boundary descriptions on their website](https://www.providenceri.gov/planning/phdc-lhd-info/).

#### Stronger Protections

<span class="abbr">LHD</span>s offer protections and enforce them at the city and state level via public comment periods and design review processes. <span class="abbr">LHD</span>s generally enforce design restrictions on major alterations like siding, roofing, and window material selection, or scale and massing as previously stated. (Paint colors are _not_ something that <span class="abbr">LHD</span>s regulate in Providence.) The commission oversees the design of home additions and new construction within a district.

When demolition is proposed, it is the <span class="abbr">LHD</span> that enforces a [demolition delay mechanism](https://pvdeye.org/should-providence-be-more-empowered-to-delay-demolitions/), if a city has one. [Providence has a delay in place and has recently strengthened its language](https://council.providenceri.gov/2024/07/18/council-holds-last-meeting-before-legislative-break-and-hears-update-on-pilot-negotiations/).

There is a fine line to walk when restricting the freedom of homeowners. To be clear, there have been [rapid demolitions in historic districts]({% link _essays/erosion-of-college-hill-historic-district.md %}) voted in favor by the <span class="abbr">PHDC</span> when homeowners or developers make a case that existing conditions contain “blight.” Enforcement by committee means that human subjectivity is at play, and in Providence, the <span class="abbr">PHDC</span> has frequently voted in favor of higher-density new construction instead of retaining smaller historic homes. The system is not perfect, but it is the system we have.

Homeowners can not always do exactly what they want when their property is under the review of an <span class="abbr">HDC</span>, but most commissions offer ways to compromise between the homeowner’s desires and the quality of the district. For the most part, <span class="abbr">HDC</span>s try not to be suppliers of red tape. Rather, they aim for a collective alignment with the historic nature that all who live and own within a district found valuable when they first moved there.

#### Limited Monetary Benefits

While property values remain high for those within a National or Local Historic District, additional grants and renovation support will vary greatly from state to state. In Rhode Island, State Tax Credits have been used for many large-scale income-producing projects, like hotels, cultural centers, and residential mill conversions.

</figure>

Inclusion in an <span class="abbr">LHD</span> may make a property eligible for various state-funded programs, though all may have limitations to the scope of what they will support. The <span class="abbr">RIHPHC</span> maintains [a few lists of grant opportunities in the state and New England region](https://preservation.ri.gov/preserve-protect/financial-assistance/grants). Will they subsidize a new set of historically accurate windows for your historic home? Likely not, as grant programs are typically reserved for non-profit or public entities. If a privately owned home is listed on the State Register of Historic Places, [there are a few opportunities to find financial support for certain projects](https://preservation.ri.gov/preserve-protect/financial-assistance/loans).

## Historic Districts and the Updated Comprehensive Plan

The [draft update to Providence’s Comprehensive Plan](https://pvdeye.org/the-comprehensive-plan-what-people-are-saying/) has many people wondering about the future of the built environment. The historic character of the City is an enormous asset and there is no doubt that increased density across the City will change the character of some historic neighborhoods. It is also a fact that the City needs more housing at a variety of price points to support the needs of the people who want to live here.

One of the concerns (as noted in the article “Gentle Density”) is that some already-dense areas are designated as “Enhanced Growth.” This means the plan recommends zoning changes that will allow for higher-density dwellings. In these areas, when there are few empty lots or buildings to be converted from non-residential use, there seems to be no ability to increase residential density without demolishing smaller homes.

As Providence is rich with historic character, it is also rich in designated historic districts. Losing small-to-medium-size houses in these areas in favor of larger, taller, and denser apartment complexes will degrade these historic districts, and in turn, gradually degrade the architectural quality of the City.

</figure>

## Should my neighbors and I create a new Local Historic District?

As the “Gentle Density” article noted, “Is it fair that just 7% of irreplaceable resources are protected? And the rest of the City is not?” The Comprehensive Plan wants to achieve higher density but also higher sustainability. Using as much as possible of the existing housing stock is the most sustainable development approach, and repurposing once-industrial buildings for housing rather than tearing them down is in line with that approach as well.

Local Historic Districts have previously favored the history of the powerful, not the disenfranchised. With construction projects like the Federal highway system and widespread “Urban Renewal” projects in the mid-20th century, many neighborhoods that deserved protections were intentionally erased.

Historians are doing more to report and recover some of what was lost, like [the story of 215 Meeting Street](https://ppsri.org/the-last-trace/), owned by a Civil War Veteran and prominent members of the Providence Black Community. Recently, [additional documentation was approved by the National Park Service](https://www.ri.gov/press/view/47444) for the College Hill Historic District and others to include documentation for properties associated with African Americans and Cape Verdeans to emphasize their significance to the history of College Hill. Federal and Local Historic Districts make this research and documentation possible.

With the Comprehensive Plan nearing finalization, it is the perfect time to assess the significance of our neighborhoods. They deserve oversight, consideration, and what protections we can give them without placing an undue burden on the rights of homeowners. While new local historic districts require work, coordination, and many conversations, they are a worthwhile investment in the character of the neighborhoods we all love so much.

Most importantly, we may be able to document or even save a property that tells a different story than the places that have already been given that privilege.

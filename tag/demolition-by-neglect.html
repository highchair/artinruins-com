description: 'Properties that have been demolished because they have deteriorated to the point of no return. Sometimes, this is intentional on the part of the owner — especially when fixing a property would cost more because of its historic significance. This could be simply because the current owner couldn’t afford any upkeep, and sometimes, it is because the building itself is very difficult to turn into something else. Other times, it is an intentional way to get people onto the side of demolition rather than preservation.'

I’ve sort of grown fond of it since, despite or maybe because of its defiant ugliness: it’s certainly like no other building downtown. I think I’ll be sad to see it go, especially if it’s replaced by another Lego-style hotel like the Westin.'

(Maybe one of us had a book of matches) After we got to the “halfway point” (when you can’t see light at either end), our eyes started playing tricks on us. It also got very damp and musty, and I remember mud squeezing up between my toes. It was downright creepy. I’m also pretty sure we weren’t the only ones down there. I had another friend who told me he used to walk though it by himself “when he was feeling depressed”.'

In a new book, tentatively entitled “The Hanger”, two students from an ivy league school in Providence have the shattering experience of discovering a body hanging deep in the tunnel. When you were there, was there debris in the tunnel, enough for a body to be launched off or would someone have to bring material like a box or a step ladder to create sufficient height? Anything hanging from a ceiling to put a rope over? When you were there, were there trickles of water? What month? Any good recent stories of tunnel hi-jinx?'

  content: 'Never walked this tunnel as I live far away but have done others. What a rich story of urban adventures since its demise of RR use. As a historian and rail expert who at night runs the oldest regional performing arts incubator in part as another urban renewal effort but with enrichment and inclusion by colleges in Philadelphia, I can appreciate all of this.


But not having this tunnel used by RRs has greatly hurt downtown Providence and your regions economic performance cutting out maybe 1/3 of its potential feeder rail network which in other cities has proven to be the key for long term vitality as much as colleges and other better known factors. However a new old day comes again and otherwise what would be another half a billion dollars to build tunnel is positioned right where it is needed again for rails if you are to have a better future and Providence is to actually stay on the Next Generation 200+ Northeast Corridor line being planned which I am advising. Before Amtrak and other entities came to the same conclusion they shouldn’t cut out Providence for this additional new line for the 21st Century as was originally being planned and still advocated by many powerful interests, I was looking at how to get a new High Speed train line to your downtown but to avoid the series of severe Pawtucket curves which are not near any, all-trains stop station like Providence. Your closest in curves including East Providence and its draw bridge to a modified underground downtown station via an attractive and even scenic new high tech single post slow double track viaduct with low (so riders can still see your attractive downtown!) wheel sound barriers and baffling over the river, streets and lower parking lots would all not be to much of a speed restricting problem for new trains that will reach well over 200mph elsewhere. Existing MBTA and any freight trains would continue on the existing line north till it again turns to sharply into the straight old line right of way to be rebuilt at that father out point where high speeds are required. Any Amtrak trains could still use the existing NEC line too if needed for critical back up if nothing dumb like to expensive and incompatible all new maglev is planned to be built for the next generations as every other country on the planet has decided in favor of evolving high speed trains (tested at 357mph by the way). Maybe more initially obvious to those who have not studied these things for as long as I have, your RR tunnel is needed to have any rail services due east of Providence too as modified local trains that would be required to share the medium speed tracks in the tunnel with slowing High Speed trains can take the place of many Light and regional rail proposals in that direction. The other old trolley tunnel could also be used for any trolleys to the top of the hill and closer in to East Providence perhaps too as I design these things for communities but would need to look closer at that then I have scouring the East Coast for solutions and best designs for the Next Gen NEC.


Providence needs to see and advocate for all this for itself or it will likely miss out on the benefits or RI would have to contribute to something much more expensive and disruptive to build rather then retrofit. NIMBYs and others who are against any change or still think we only subsidies transit travel in this country need to be shown how this is the best solutions. Any who doubt something much faster is coming to the NEC should understand that the two initial High Speed lines built in the world by the Japanesse and later the French after studying our line in the 1950s are most like the NEC demographically and otherwise mostly both made their total costs back (planning, building, equipment, operation and ongoing in-kind replacement shares) back within 10 years of opening even faster then I had realized due to the lines being used to finance thousands of other miles of more! Key politicians on both sides of the political divide who are supporting the Next Gen HS NEC are now learning this fact which has been vetted by a major Midwest University study for another lesser corridor there.'

  content: 'I attended Brown 1974-78. On Halloween of my freshman year, several friends and I traversed the tunnel in costumes, walking east to west with no flashlights. We walked all the way to the Union Station (at that time, on Kennedy Plaza, not below the State Capitol where the present station stands) and startled the train customers as we strolled nonchalantly through the lobby.


The Science Library at Brown sits directly over the tunnel at the corner of Thayer and Waterman Streets. In the 1970s, freight trains still operated in the tunnel. If you were in the library at the proper time, you could feel subterranean rumbling. Several times I raced by elevator to the top floor of the library and caught the Seekonk bridge in the horizontal position, further proof that a train was using the tunnel, though I was never lucky enough to actually SEE a train crossing the Seekonk River.


I continued in graduate school at Brown, but by 1980 I no longer used the library and am unable to comment on which year the trains stopped using the tunnel. I am certain they operated at least through 1980. On my first post-graduation visit to Providence in 1989, the viaduct that carried the tracks over Main Street from the west tunnel portal to Union Station had been dismantled, but the tunnel portal had not yet been sealed off with the steel doors.'

One of our big dares was walking it alone! In the late 1960’s it was a place to hang out at times, mostly on the Gano St. side. In The whole area around the tunnel was a playground for us as kids. There were ponds on both sides of the Seekonk that we use to skate on, catch turtles, etc. and generally hang out. We use to hop on the trains going through and ride to either downtown or across to East Providence. I remember we use to lay pennies on the tracks so the trains would flatten them. And the big thing when we were older was, we use to climb the train bridge when it was up. That was cool. We use to call it the Black Bridge.'

A homeless guy was encountered inside the entrance a ways, standing over a little campfire but he didn’t give us any grief. The wind howling thru the tunnel made it way colder and once we hit the middle where the tunnel turns left we were plunged into darkness. Couldn’t see either lights at the end of the tunnel. Naturally we didn’t bring flashlights and the effect was creepy to say the least. Not my idea of a pleasant experience but it did elevate the senses. It felt like you were caving under a mountain and all you could hear were bats and the endless drip, drip, drip. As we headed for the East entrance, light was seen again and although no one said anything I think we were a little relieved. Tough guys, eh? One scary feature were the icicles hanging from the tunnel ceiling. These suckers were easily 8-10 feet long and my imagination got the best of me. I was constantly shifting my line to prevent from walking directly beneath any of them. That bit of fun now over, we spilled out into the open East side where the old rusted hulk of a train bridge headed out over the river. We stopped to huddle for a minute, wishing we had some beer to celebrate the historic crossing. Then realizing we needed to return, we turned and plunged back in. Funny though, I don’t remember a damn thing about it.'

When the fog stopped, and they went in, there was lots of water near the ground, and some dripping off the ceiling. He said that at some points it was so deep they had to walk their bikes through. Also, he said that there we open manholes, so you had to be extremly careful, so as not to fall through one. He said it was an extremely creepy experience, but a really awesome one too, because it had a sense of danger and trouble.'

Homeless drunks, drug addicts and sometimes demented people (as someone documented an encounter with) lived in there and would clamber up the side to Benefit Street to beg, or accost people on North Main. One newsmaking event involved RISD students having some kind of year-end party ritual that was like the aforementioned LaSalle one, only that it was far more “artsy” and tribal in nature – kind of like a proto Rave party — it involved drums, torches, bonfires, running naked (in some cases) and chanting and overall boisterousness. Police were called in for what was called in about as a “Satanic ritual” (hardly) and a near riot occurred when they shut it down, lots of people hauled in including bystanders on Benefit, one of whom was apparently injured, mistaken for a reveler. That was about the time they decided to board it up as I recall. It had an urban legend of creepiness about the whole place, that fit well into H.P Lovecraft mythos in Providence, and I even knew a guy who wrote a horror story about it. '

We would either hang on the ladders or sometimes hop into an open car. On at least one occasion we rode from E. Providence, across the Jack Knife Bridge and through the entire tunnel into downtown Providence!


We walked through the tunnel many times and it was always an adventure. We would always encounter some low-lifers who would threaten us, and it got pretty loud in there when a train would go by. You could create some great echos in there also. Looking back at those years, this was definately some of the more dangerous and stupid stuff we did.'

As we carefully navigated the track, all that was visible was the bright pinpoint of light from the opposite end. It was an amazingly cathartic experience and when we emerged from the tunnel on the east side we all felt like we had somehow been reborn.


We took several trips through the tunnel in the year that followed. Once we brought torches, but, while fun, it definitely lessened the experience. Plunging oneself into total darkness in an uncertain landscape frightened us, and made our other senses more alive.


On one of the trips, we were confronted by a huge guy and his disfigured little friend, who were in the process of finishing off a case of Bud cans by the bridge on the east side. We didn’t even notice them off to the side of the tracks until the big one said “Hey! Did you make a noise!” and the little guy goes “We gonna f--- you UP!” After 20 extremely uncomfortable minutes I guess they decided we weren’t worth the effort. So we walked back home above ground, laughing off our strange fortune.'

The incredible Chain of Rocks bridge on Route 66 was given a reprieve but no matter how historic it was -- and it WAS; I am an architectural historian -- the Jamestown Bridge was doomed the second those filthy liars at the Army Corps said “oh, if you let us build a new one we promise to keep the old one for bicycle traffic, or pedestrians, or fishing…” I don’t need to see an indoctrinator because I see conspiracies; I now WORK for the Feds so fully understand how often lies and manipulation take place in our nation.

By the time we got there, the only things that were left from the castle were the copper beech tree (there were some other, newer trees, but we are guessing that Olmstead picked out the beech), the massive stone gates and the hedge. We designed the house around the beech tree. 


There is also a massive concrete piling right at the corner of the Shaw Avenue and Narragansett Bay escarpments (which is not actually part of the lot that I purchased). I was told that that was one of the footing for Dutee Flint’s transmission tower – it was certainly big enough.


We put a lot of effort into respecting and honoring the location and the neighborhood when we built that house – I hope that it showed.


Finally, when we used to point out the tree and the hedge and talk about Frederick Law Olmstead, we usually pointed out that he was the landscape architect for both NYC’s Central Park and Montreal’s Mont Royal Park as well.'

Biographical and anecdotal information I have indicates he may have retired sometime in the 1920’s, as he and his wife and two daughters moved to Niagara Falls sometime in that time, possibly early 1930’s, perhaps as a result of the Depression. Does anyone know how the company fared during that time? I know Arthur made a good living, because he took a lot of family photographs around the turn of the century, and you needed money to own a camera and have film developed at that time. Any info would be appreciated. THANKS!'

My ancestors served as the official Assay Masters of the Birmingham Assay Office for nearly two centuries — and my father is known for his work in metallurgy — and we’re all from Birmingham, England. There has to be a story to all this! I know that several Westwoods resided in Rhode Island in the 17th and 18th centuries, then moved on to CT and MA. Is there a link? I don’t know, but as a historian and archaeologist, I’d love to find out. Please point me in the right direction! Humbly, AJC Westwood (Abi)'

Working at Gorham as a designer, technical illustrator, and sample maker was the most incredible experience. Trained as a silversmith at Maine College of Art, this was a dream come true as I roamed virtually every square foot of the plant, amazed at everything I saw. Studying the history of this turn of the century greatest silver company in the world leaves me sad as to what it is today – just a name. My experiences at Gorham have helped shape my 30-year career as a silver restoration, conservation, and preservation specialist. I carry with me the techniques I learned and the friendships I developed and hold dear to this day.

The letter came from a Ethel Bird and I do have confirmation she died when she was 98. It was sent in the War (World War 2) and I think perhaps they like to have it. It tells how difficult in England it was at that time. I was born in 1947 so I only remember sweets were difficult to come by! If you could help me, I would be really pleased. As I am not computer literature, I am not even sure how I got on to your site - sorry. I do know William was a Silversmith and went to the USA from Birmingham and worked for Gorham ?

We used to cross the Jamestown Bridge to catch the ferry to Newport Naval Hospital. The Newport Bridge was just under construction at that time, the towers were just being erected. Since I had grown up in Throgg’s Neck in the Bronx (NY) I had the rare privelege of seeing that being built, a sight which I partook of every single day! I would compare the Newport Bridge Construction with the Throggs Neck, and sort of “anticipated” what was to come next, being quite taken by the difference of proportion for each structure. Some of the other Seabees and I had the opportunity to cross the Jamestown Bridge early in the morning hours (I think it was in 1965). The road was desolate, and we had the chance to talk to the toll collector about the bridge. This good natured man patiently accepted our humor in his inimitable New England Way. He then “locked our jaws” when he told us the story about the hurricane in the ’40s where the bridge swayed so much that they …“thought they were going to lose it”.


I have been building bridges for the last 40 years with Consulting Engineers and Contractors and the anecdotes written by the others on this page have touched my heart. I give great credit to the imaginative engineers, designers and detailers who turned raw steel into the beautiful structures such as the Jamestown and other bridges which capture our hearts and minds, and I am in awe of the research scientist / engineers who have developed the techniques we use today which have rendered the beautiful “riveted filigrees of steel” in our old bridges their rightful, respected place in history. 


If you love bridges and other civil structures, consider joining our industry! We need talented, imaginative people to both design and build the beautiful bridges that may someday captivate the hearts and minds of a future generation! '

  content: 'My first memories are having to go over that bridge every day in a school bus for Newport YMCA summer camp when I was about ten. I used to dread that part of the trip every single day. Later, for the rare “long trips” to Rocky Point (anything off Aquidneck Island is considered a “trip”) once I started driving in the late 80’s, I remember the white knuckles at the top, praying traffic wouldn’t stop. The one time traffic did stop, we were (of course) at the top and everyone was practically holding their breath. Even without the grates, the steep incline (which in memory is probably more steep than it really was) was scarey enough. By the early 90’s I was used to it and it was just narrow (like driving on East Main Road). Sure, the grates made you uneasy, but after you had a few trips under your belt it got easier. I almost forgot about the grates. That was until I got my motorcycle license and “forgot” about the grates until I was already on the bridge. Of course it was rush hour, and following cars showed no mercy. All the way up I was worried about how slippery it would be and if I would drop the bike and “cheese grate” myself. It wasn’t until I was on the grates (now going at about 5mph not caring about the cars behind me) that it was a view straight down as if nothing was under you. That was the closest I ever came to literally almost wetting myself. I went back through Providence that day and never went over on the motorcycle again.'

I remember all of the good fishing off of the bridge an seeing it come down was a good thing. It has served its long purpose and now it was time for a new one. hopefully this one will bring those there the many wonderful memories that the old bridge has brought to me.'

Off all the bridges I had ever been on, this one was where I had to be the most cautious driving. Regarding the shaking, people tell me if I thought the Mt. Hope Bridge was rough, then I hadn’t drove the Jamestown bridge enough. Still the bridge was beautiful to look at, it was one of the things a URI student had to experience. When I go back to RI and see the Bay I feel the absence of not seeing the bridge there. It’s like part of my college days died. '

The Jamestown bridge always had seaguls on it and somtimes people posted advertisments on it so when people drove by they could see it. Whenever we crossed the bridge I thought that it would colapse on us, but it never did. The bridge was all rusty and looked like it could collapse any minute. They kept telling us that they would blow it up, but they never did until now. It made me sad because I will always remeber that bridge as part of my child hood. Whenever we crossed the bridge that was the only thing I would watch because it was so cool. '

As we crossed the bridge, I couldn’t believe how  steep it was and how narrow the lanes were. Like some other people who have posted here, I am relatively afraid of heights, but the anxiety  of crossing the bridge had an exhilerating effect. As we were crossing, a truck approached from the opposite direction, and even in my tiny  Beetle we had to pull over till the tires were almost scraping the curb  on the right. Feeling the wind make the bridge sway was certainly an  experience, too. Over the past couple of years, I’ve enjoyed seeing  the old bridge alongside the new bridge as we would cross, and I was brought back to that trip. I wish I could have driven over it one more  time before they took it down.'

My tenure in the USAF ended shortly after and I drove to the Island for the first time straight through from Little Rock Air Force Base. I was driving a (Motorhead) ‘53 Chevy that I had just put a V-8 engine in. I arrived at the Jamestown Bridge around 9 o’clock in the evening. I paid my toll, knew that I was on the last leg of my journey…That long, narrow, high bridge was like my “yellow brick road” or “stairway to heaven”; and there wasn’t a soul on the bridge. I went through the gears and flew up that thing. I remember hitting the peak ; losing sight of the road due to the steep incline, a weird zig zagging feeling, the growl of the tires on the grate and me just screaming “woah”. I exited the bridge on the Jamestown side feeling like I had just been on a really great rollercoaster ride. I might add, that all trips over the bridge since that night, that my speed was a little more reasonable.'

The meal always included little dishes with pickled beets, coleslaw and fries. My second favorite was Chen’s on Washington St. — near the old City Hall Hardware. Chen’s was upstairs and one of the Chinese actors used to eat there when he was in town. Think he was the one who spoke of Son #1 and Son 2? Also — at Mee Hongs we used to see an older lady who my friend’s mom said to have Roger Williams buried in her back yard!

Dad and Mr. Luke (as I would call him)  would talk for a little bit and then the food would come. While I don’t remember everything we got, I remember the beef fried rice and the pupu platters. a kid cooking with a stick on an open flame, what could be better? There was always a fight over who would get the last of it. It was moist and I’m sure the beef had been marinated. Now most places fried rice is dry. I remember the décor, and the fact that it felt like a restaurant, not a take out place. Don’t see many Chinese restaurants like that anymore and I haven’t seen one in decades. I’d love to know if any relatives are still cooking with the old recipes, I would make the trip to RI. '

My parents and Grandparents ordered chow mein or chop suey. Yuck! My sister and I had an open turkey sandwich on white bread points with brown gravy chosen from the children’s menu.  An earlier post commented on the large pickled beets. I remember them! My dad loved them! I enjoyed the delicious fries. I must have gotten “cole slaw, peas or beets” also mentioned earlier, but do not remember which. Mee Hong’s was dark and quiet at 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon. We were often the only customers at that time. Outside, the front facade had a large circle with pinky/red (that’s what I remember) neon light illuminating brightly. The sign must have been there too. It’s a great visual memory! I wish there was still a great Chinese restaurant around that felt just like that. Nostalgia. Days gone by with the best memories. '

Their food was really good and then I discovered Kubla Khan on Weybosset Street. I think I ate at all of the Chinese Restaurants in in Providence, Downcity except Mee Hong’s and Ming Garden.

The food was excellent but the really endearing feature was that they had the most beautiful relaxing subdued blue cerulean lights in the ceiling. They were recessed and behind a circular projection so you did not see any florescent bulbs, only the reflection of the blue light from the ceiling. It gave the most relaxing atmosphere. I do recall there were Chinese scenes on the walls too. What the name of it was eludes me, I’m going back something like half a century. (**A.I.R.**: Sounds to us like you are describing Mee Hong)'

The lights were low and I remember the booths were red vinyl. They served bread and butter with the Chinese food, which I have never seen anywhere else. The chicken wings had a very good black sauce. I loved the neon, it lit up that little street. I think they had a special drink menu with a Scorpion Bowl that you could share with friends, but it was expensive.  Lots of gay people went there and we always felt comfortable and welcome. The Ming Garden was more upscale than Luke’s. It was more expensive but the linens and furniture were more modern and elegant. It was special to eat upstairs. I can remember going there with my friends and they all ordered their food "no MSG". Providence was a great place in the early 1980s and I have many fond memories of those times.'

My father approved of Mee Hong as opposed to some of the other Chinese restaurants in RI (ie, Hon Hongs, Luke’s, etc.) because he was of the belief that Mee Hong did not use pork in its Chop Suey or Chow Mein (basically the only two items most of us were allowed to order). So, my entire family would go there on special occasions for Sunday dinners, always accompanied by bread, butter, and “Cole Slaw, Peas or Beets?” (this was the oft-repeated refrain of every waiter in the place). And my mother and I frequented the restaurant for Saturday luncheons before shopping downtown. I became totally turned off to Chop Suey AND Chow Mein (who knew the difference) after an episode of having been given a Chop Suey (or Chow Mein) sandwich. I have never been able to eat soggy bread – and that was the soggiest bread I had ever eaten. The rest of my family, however, loved the soggy sandwiches. Two bites of the sandwich and I spent the rest of the afternoon – well, I don’t want to go into the details, but you may feel free to use your imagination. That was the end of Chinese food eating for me, but not the end of Chinese restaurants. I came to adore Mee Hong’s batter fried fish and chips – also served with bread, butter and “Cole Slaw, Peas or Beets” (I always got the cole slaw). The fish was nearly tripled in size after having been batter dipped and deep fried and I couldn’t get enough of it (actually I could never finish it). I was chastised both by my father, and an Aunt who also took me to Mee Hong on occasion, for eating a non-Chinese dish in a Chinese restaurant. Fast foward about ten years, and in Washington, DC a date wanted to take me out for Chinese food. I could only remember Chop Suey and Chow Mein and wanted to decline. I was convinced to give it a try and was delighted to learn about the glories of chinese spare ribs, shrimp toast, mu shu chicken (never pork!), and some szchuan and hunan delights. I became a fan, once again, of Chinese cuisine. But I am very sad to learn, upon returning to my native State of RI, that Mee Hong, Hon Hong, Port Arthur, Luke’s and Ming Garden have disappeared from the tapestry of downtown Providence.'

  content: 'My father went to work for J & H Electric Co. part-time in 1919, while still in high school, and, after learning his trade as an armature winder and electrician, he retired from the company 47 years later as shop foreman. As a youth, I spent many hours keeping him company when he worked overtime on nights and weekends rewinding motors, some of which were over 200 HP in size.


The basement of the building was where the old wire coils were stripped out of motors prior to installing new ones, and this area also contained a large in ground varnish tank in which newly rewound motors were dipped and sealed with a special type of varnish, in order to protect the coils and insulation, then baked in a large oven to cure the varnish. The oven was also used to bake the moisture out of motors that had been underwater in floods, etc. The first floor contained the reception counter, the large motor department, a machine shop, locker room, and the loading dock/shipping department. The second floor housed the buisness offices, stock room, and the belt and drive department. On the third floor small motors and power tools were repaired, and it also housed the coil making department ,which produced custom-made. replacement coils for the large motor repair department. Specialized electical control panels of various types were also designed and built by J & H.


The company was frequently called upon to service electic motors aboard many of the ships that came into the port of Providence. They also took care of motors and related equipment in many local jewelry manufacturing sites. Much of that work was done on an annual basis during the 4th of July week, when many factories closed for vacation. The company also did commercial wiring.


I remember my Dad telling me how, during the 1938 hurricane, he left the building just in time to get out of the downtown area before it was flooded. Several fellow workers, who stayed around to talk after quitting time, found themselves stranded and their cars under water.


It was nice to learn that the building is soon to be put to new use, now that it no longer is the home of J & H Electric Co.'

Novelties stocked on shelves up to the high ceilings in no discernible order. But old man Morris always knew exactly where everything was, from spider rings to Chinese finger traps. Rumor was, there was a back room where were certain off-limits movies could be sampled, but I was just a kid and never confirmed this. Across the street was a large meat packing operation and the Blarney Stone bar, where in future years my friend Henry and I sometimes sampled a draft Guinness (rare in RI back then). It adjoined the Triple Diamond social club... to us a mysterious association with some Irish connection. Interestingly, other than negotiating craftily on pricing for a grand gross of live boxed chameleons (for real), the only thing I remember about old man Morris was his anger at the fire department. He hated firefighters with an obsessive passion, and could go on for a long time about how often they water-damaged his goods and axed his doors for no good reason. Ironic that the place eventually succumbed to fire.'

He operated a business named Beacon Realty, which, during Prohibition, was used as a front for his Pawtucket brewery. Clients would come in and order (and prepay) for kegs of full strength beer (“near” beer was allowed to be made), which was made at the former Hand brewery. Lavell also ran a speakeasy down the street at 24-28 Fountain St, which 
boasted the “world’s longest bar”, which eventually became the more familiar Doorley’s. The site is now a parking lot. Lavell, who was arrested and convicted of federal tax evasion in 1931, went on to re-name the brewery the Rhode Island Brewing Company and operated it until his death in 1939. I am also told that the basement extends under the sidewalk. I am unsure of what has happened to the little building since the 30s; I would hope that if the adjacent parking lots are developed, that the building is incorporated into the new structures.'

To this day I can still hear the music from that carousel… I think I may have sustained a little drain bamage from it!!! To play Cat Rack you would have to throw a baseball at some very fuzzy (mostly fuzz!) stuffed cats and knock them down. Duck Pond consisted of about 100 identical plastic ducks that floated in a continuous loop past the customer… usually a very young child. They would pick up the duck and see what number was on the bottom, then pick their prize! It was a fun place to work (making $1.42 per hour!), and sometimes we used to have fun little parties in the parking lot when we got off work. I also remember two of the “regular” customers who would arrive most Sundays… both were men, but one would be dressed as a woman with blonde wig and heels!!!'

All afternoon and evening, when I was working, I listened to the carousel music. It was impossible not to hear the music. Fifty years later, if I think about it, I can still hear the music in my head. I was at the carousel on Sept. 26 2015, two weeks ago, riding the carousel and having chowder and clam cakes.  I’m glad East Providence saved it from being torn down or sold.


Does anyone remember Emancipation Day, August 1, of each year? Someone mentioned rock and roll concerts. I seem to think I saw Dionne Warwick there at the beginning of her career in 1962. On Thursday evenings, there would be dances at the Alhambra Ballroom. You could tell when there was a break in the music at the Ballroom because these couples in ballroom attire would stroll up the midway. They looked out of place among the more casual attire of the other parkgoers.


By the time the Alhambra Ballroom burned in 1969, it had been turned into the Sugarberry Lounge. My father knew the chief of police for East Providence. He told us a story about the police chief. He said the police were frequent visitors to the Sugarberry Lounge to break up fights, etc. One night, the police chief was present as several teenage boys were brought out of the Lounge by other police officers. When one teenager emerged, the police chief hit him across the face. One of the other officers said, “What did you do that for?” The chief said, “That’s my son!”'

In 1950, the facade received a major face lift by park painter Len Minor and it was renamed Laff In The Dark. New stunts were purchased to supplement the original Pretzel figures. It closed after the 1963 season and the building became part of the park’s new Wild West walk-through fun house, aka “Hotel.” More info can be found here: <a href="//laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelogic/crescentpretzel.htm">laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelogic/crescentpretzel.htm</a> and <a href="//laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelride/pretzelride1.htm">laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelride/pretzelride1.htm</a>'

I recall the Ride standing and operating with the big roller coaster still running behind it. I was IN the ride at the ’Swamp’ turn when the coaster cars went flying by behind the building. Yes, you could hear them!


Does anyone remember the Laff In The Dark ride? There were the usual light-up stunts all the way along, but the cars jerked into and out of the turns. The set-up crew knew exactly how to lay out the track so the cars would just miss each other. Now THAT was scary! I saw the track with a pocket flashlight (cheating) and found that the first few turn degrees were removed and put on the end of each turn. No WONDER the cars jerked!


By the way, the condos were built on the old parking lot. They don’t extend into the midway. Crescent Park would be alive today if management had promoted ’The Park FIRST‘ like it should have. Long live Crescent Park!'

The carousel remains as the jewel that reminds us of the times before giant theme parks. Recently, through the efforts of the Serowik family, almost all of the outside horses have been refinished and a museum is being created where people can share in the magical memories of what once was.'

Charlotte worked at the park in the McCusker stand making cotton candy. I began working at the park in 1959 in Kiddy Land and left the park in 65 or 66. These were the best years of my life for a lot of reasons but most importantly Cresent Park is where I met Charlotte. We have been married 42 years and we met in 1960.'

I remember eating clam chowder and clamcakes and corn. I enjoyed my nights as a teenager hanging out with friends Ginny and the rest of the gang, at Crescent Park. A few years ago I took my family to Riverside and was so happy that I could share the wonderful carousel with my children.  They got to catch the ring and toss it into the clowns mouth. There was even a little food stand just outside of the carousel so my kids got to eat clamcakes, THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!!'

I remember on a slow day, I was giving the operator of the “Flying Fish” a break. I assumed that no one was currently on the ride… I was wrong. I ran over to the 3 levers that stopped the cars just as a little girl came zooming around the corner. I only got to one lever in time and the car only slowed a little. As I watched helplessly, she smashed into the other cars, knocking them all over the place. I ran to her to help, but she just looked up at me and whispered “Can I go again?”'

I grew up in East Providence in the 1940s and Crescent Park was such a big adventure for my family. Planning for weeks only heightened the desire to finally get there, to ride the wonderful Looff carousel and to reach for that brass ring. It was always a family event that took up the whole day and night. I still think that the best clamcakes and chowder ever was served there. My parents and the older folks settled into the Shore Dinner Hall for a day of eating and imbibing of good old Narragansett Beer which was served in quart bottles which somehow never got empty. then it was chowder, steamers, lobster, corn which seemed to go on and on. The children got to explore the Midway with all of it’s games of chance and promises of great treasures to bring home and enjoy forever. We felt so grown up in the Dodge em Cars as we spun around and enjoyed the fun. The Fun House was both fun and scary to all of us and we stuck very close together until we got to the mirrors and laughed and laughed at how strange we looked. Too soon it was getting dark and the music was starting up as we watched young and old alike dance and twirl around the Alahambra ballroom. And then it was time to go home. Oh what grand days they were… Thanks for the memories.'

So i made some friends and went to the park for my very first time. My favorite ride was the flying fish. Still to this day there is no rollercoaster like that. They had string bracelets with different colors each day. We used to make them and go four days a week all summer. All the way up to 1977 when it closed. Those were precious years i’ll never forget.

  content: 'I worked in the park summers in late 50s thru early 60s. I ran various gambling stands where people put dimes on numbers and I spun a wheel. There was the radio stand, gift stand, cigarette stand, stuffed animal stand. I also ran the hoopla stand where people tried to throw wooden hoops over prizes mounted on block of wood. I ran the ski-ball stand and got pretty good at that game. We had a dime mounted on a piece of wire that we used to give free games. 


I remember each summer Emancipation Day when all the blacks would come down from Providence and get rowdy. We white middle class suburbanites were always on edge because occasionally there would be fights and violence. The police in those days had a lot of leeway to handle troublemakers. They had long wooden clubs, blackjacks and a vicious devise called the iron claw.


There was this girl we called “Angie the pump” who would provide sexual favors behind the Alhambra Ballroom. Once I remember the ambulance coming to get some guy who had a heart attack doing Angie behind the dance hall. 


I really miss the place, the great wooden coaster, long summer days and interesting people. '

Our lives were much simpler back in the late 50’s and early 60’s. The mid-way had so much to offer, clam cakes and chowder, salt water taffy, many fun activities, and the dodge’em and satellite were fun also. We danced at the Alhambra Ballroom, went on boat rides, and ate dinner with family and friends at the Shore Dinner Hall. There were free open-air concerts on Sundays for all to enjoy. Those are cherished memories of experiences that I wish my Children and Grandchildren could have if even for just one day.<br>

My wife and i freqently visit it with our two boys. It is wonderfull that there is still some of it left for children to enjoy and others to watch and remember fond memories. the spirit of the park lives in the carousel you can feel it in the air and hear it in the sounds of the music . The chatter of the memories and the making of new will always live on. I hope someday my boys will be able to bring their children and give them a chance to grab a gold ring.. to all who were involved in the restoration and the saving of the carousel we thank you. to those who keep it up and running and open, you keep the spirit of the park and memories alive.'

I remember alternating trips to Rocky Point & Crescent – a few times per month during the summers of the 1960s and early 1970s. Personally, I favored Crescent Park – there was a magical aura of slowly driving down Bullocks Point Avenue and seeing the luminated “Flying Fish” lit sign grow larger and larger as we approached the park. Fondly remember playing “Dixieland” and “Moulon Rouge” pinball machines in the arcade. Afterwards, taking a turn on the Dodgems across the way. Loved the comical wall mural on the back wall. Next, would take a ride on the “Bubble-Bounce”. And, of course, the favorite attraction was the “Showboat” dark ride. Still remember the animated musicians rocking and rolling, and, the kinda scary pirate who would go round and round on the top floor. Lastly, took some nudging from friends to finally take a liking to the western-themed walk-thru fun house across from the Showboat. Think as a little kid, the animated large laughing lady in the front entrance window scared me!! To this day, we still go back to the park to ride the great Looff carousel. At times, I will walk to the back of the attraction and peer down the stretch of grassy land and imagine what once was a magical midway!!'

I worked with a woman who had worked at the park for 50 years – May Ford. She had the most marvelous memories of the park. I had friends working all over the park.

McCusker) McCusker’s Taffy and Popcorn was the best around and there is a story about the recipe for the Carmelized popcorn. The recipe was bought in Atlantic City and to this day remains as a secret recipe on a yellowed piece of paper. Fredddie McCusker’s son, known back then as Little Freddie, resides in Florida and has possession of that recipe. Much of my family also lives in Florida. Many Park pictures in photo albums, bring back so many great times. I can still smell the odors that came from the midway and hear the music that seemed to never stop. Ahh the good ole days. By the way, the marble slab that the taffy was made on, was stored in my Grandparents garage. My GrandMother had once given it to me back in the early 70’s. By then it was sinking into the sand floor of the garage. I had no way to remove the slab and it is still there. My Brother now owns that home, marble slab and all:-) Too many stories to actually post here.'

I worked here many summers in my teen years defrosting the giant freezers, we would cut off the supply of cold brine going to the room, the pump heated brine thru the pipes, then literally, beat the ice off the pipes, shovel the ice up and dump it in the parking lot, 6 foot snow pile in August… I also got to paint the old steam engines that were inoperable but still in the engine room. I did lots of cleaning and painting in and on this building. I also did some exploring, some areas of this building were very creepy. There was a couple old elevators that ran off water pressure to move them, my Dad got them working once just so we could say we rode them (talk about creepy) these were scary and slow, but was an experience I will not soon forget. He worked here until it closed for good, broke his heart when it was torn down… Anyway many good memories with Dad in here.'

There was a tunnel that led from the main underground tunnel across the street to Merchants Cold Storage. It was never used during my time there, but my father remembers it. Once, after Maide Rite left the building and PFD was using it for training, a friend and I went exploring and found a door ajar. That building was huge, with what looked like Teak flooring and mazes of stairways. I did venture into the basement to see the other side of the tunnel. I didn’t stay there long because it was dark, humid, moldy, and very creepy. Since I did work across the street I was familiar with the size of the rats and the vagrents that frequented the outside dock area I didn’t stay long. One of the homeless’ names was “Buckshot” who liked to frequent to loading docks after hours to get loaded or take a nap.'

We found just piles of old restraunt items and paperwork but behind a large wooden sliding door…


We came across a tunnel with cages on each side. They held old furniture and other junk. We followed the tunnel to another sliding door and came to a staircase with peeling greenish blue paint. We went up the stairs and realized we were in the warehouse next door. A giant room that was once a freezer or refriderator was the whole first floor. More junk on the second and what looked like an apartment on the top floor. Letters were found in the closet that reviled children working at the factory that “had to get up early in the morning to shovel coal into the furnace before they could start work because it was so cold.” Do you have any info on that or the tunnel of cages?

Does anybody else remember "The Warehouse"? I seem to recall or at least think it was somehow associated with, or to, one of RI’s first early, big music/rock promoters: Skip Chernov (sp?). Maybe the old "Warehouse" ended being knocked down and then all the other stuff then developed over time’s course. Any older parents (or even grandparents) the others of you can maybe casually ask if they’d ever been to the Warehouse – over 40 years ago? I also went to the Bootlegger and Shooters off and on on very rare occasions later, just to see how much it’d changed from what I remembered from my 20s. Compared to what it ultimately became, that early "Warehouse" was just that... more a converted warehouse then anything else. But it was there.'

It was opened by Carmine D’Elena, Joe Cirelli and Dr. Ken Silvestri. My management team was brought up from Ft Lauderdale and included Bar Manager, Jamie Welch; a bartender/trainer named Bart, a waiter/trainer, named Tony Landells and the General Manager, whose name I can’t recall, who later became an attorney. (He was from Buffalo, was crazy and a great guy). Later the Izzo family of Metals Recycling in Johnston bought it and Jack Walrond became the General Manager. (I think he owns a restaurant on Main Street in East Greenwich now). Doug Palmieri, formally of WHJY, was my barback, as was Johnny from the Newport band, “Those Guys”.  I can say without question that working there was the most fun I ever had. On opening night, I worked with a girl named Beth at a portable bar on the roof. (Beth was... well let’s just say very well put together, which is why we made $350 each that night just serving canned beer and wine in plastic cups. (Man, I think my finger nails almost feel off from reaching in that ice water and opening those pop tops all night.) Over the five years or so that I worked there, I saw soooo many amazing things. For example, when the night ended we would go up to the roof and watch, “Friday Night at the Fights”. It was amazing how many people I saw get knocked out cold. The best body contests at the pool bar on Saturday afternoons were a blast. Then when they decided to put a roof on the top level and make it a dance club, we could work year round. <br><br>
Now that I am in my early forties and drive by the building, it makes me sad and makes me smile at the same time. I think about the over 200 bartenders and 400 cocktail waitresses I worked with in that 5 plus years and wonder what happened to everyone? How did it fail?  We would ring over $19,000-$20,000 at the Pub bar in one night ... in freaking 1990?????! Think about that? How much did we have to serve to ring those numbers every night when an Absolute was $3.75? Frozen mudslides with Bailey’s, Kahlua and Vodka and Ice (no cream) were $5.00. Heineken was $3.00 and Bud was $2.00. How did that place fail?????? That was just one bar. We had three more on the top floor and also had the pool bar, which was always just as busy as the pub?????!!!!!!!!! That place was soooo much fun!!!!!!!!! I hope it comes back.'

The stairwells are all intact and from experience appear “safe” The place is littered with colorful broken glass, beer cans, and spray paint cans. Wires are hanging everywhere, and portions of the ceilings and insulation are falling in. The first floor has been gutted out. My friend and I only peaked in this room, because there was a missing wall, and some construction workers next door would have seen us.

A condominium tower was proposed for the site, which was at the time the boat repair yard of Maloney &amp; Rubien. Two model units were constructed and many units were presold, but when the stock market crashed in October, 1987, the financing could not be consummated. Cerilli obtained a franchise from Shooter’s and built the club at great speed and cost because of time limits in the franchise agreement. The cost of the failed development and the construction costs were too much for the restaurant to support, even with new partners. '

Shooters was financed in part with UDAG Grant money, a federal urban development program. It is incomprehensible to me that the feds were not aware of the path of the new highway at that time.

I know he made tons of $ off the place however he lost out when the state took it and is prolly not happy that its still there.

I also remember that around ‘95 or ‘96, it became known as Bombers. I am not sure if the name was used for the entire complex or just the top floor club area. It had a fireplace and couches at one point, but that incarnation might have been for something other than Bombers. Also, the place has not always been so colorful.

I worked there as my first job – at 15 years old. I worked for the then owners Mr Hurley and Mr Jones. I was “The Farmer” – the job to have. The Farmer was responsible for all the daily maintenance of the park, kitchen and rides and care of the animals in the petting zoo as well as giving each ride worker thier lunch break – the “fixit” guy. I worked there from around 1984 till the end of 86 when I got into a big arguement with Mr Hurley over the care of the animals and walked out, apparently using a little bit more than a capfull of detergent to clean the animals barn floor cost too much. Went back about two weeks later when asked to come fix the main bearing on the scrambler by the manager (she was a family friend – and how I got the job).


Mr Jones and Mr Hurley sold the park to a couple of guys that ran a go cart track out on the Cape. That is when the park began to go to pieces – they just wouldn’t spend any money at all on anything (even worse than Mr Hurley) and I left permanently after that. Took my kids there around 2002, and it was a far cry from what it had been.


When I worked there they had the Roller Coaster, the Ferris Wheel, the Mary Go Round, the Scrambler, the Octopus, the little battery powered bumper cars (not the remnents of those in one of the pictures), and a small little boat ride thing down near the shoe. Oh, and of course the very annoying kiddie music that blared throughout the park every day over and over and over.'

The “shoe” with a slide, the little school house, etc. It was a nice setting for very small kids, but not much to do beyond running in and out of the buildings and pay a quarter for a handful of pellets to feed the goats in the pen. The last time we went, they’d put in that little roller coaster. It didn’t look very safe, so we passed on that one. They had a small go-cart track, and one of those boat rides that go in a circle in a litle bit of water. Kids rang the boat bells until the head explodes.

The Enchanted Forest had many fun rides, such as the Ferris wheel, the swing-out merry go-round, a Tilt-a-Whirl, etc. Around 2001 I worked there and it was nothing even close to the same. Rockwell Amusements took it over and basically ran it into the ground. I remember working the coaster one day and as it went up the hill, it caught on the chain and fell back down the hill injuring a couple of people. The owner of the park told me to tell them to leave if they had a problem. They also imported boring rides such as helicopters, some fish thing that went in a circle and a train without enough horsepower to go around the track. You would have to go and push it around the track; and this was for $8 an hour at a summer job. The gokarts would spark and the Titanic slide they bought collapsed on numerous occasions. Word of mouth killed that place. Also the animals were terribly mistreated and there were food poisoning outbreaks from the kitchen. All in all I would say may the Enchanted Forest rest in peace; finally.'

The humidity control system was a simple one, when the humidity on the inside rose well above that on the outside six exhaust fans would automatically turn on and lower the humidity significantly. In a misplaced zeal to save energy during the crisis in the seventies some consultant simply CUT the control wiring. This madness may have saved Brown University a few dollars but it cost them a wonderful building.'

I remember going in on cold, snowy evenings and feeling the cold air, the smell of roasting peanuts, cigars. My bothers would go down to the Red’s bench early to watch the players come out for pre-game warmups. One evening, my uncle gave me a player’s stick of Yves Locus which I still have, and a print of the Auditoruim, or Arena as many called it, painted by a local artist hanging in my room in New Orleans where I currently live. I wish the building could have been preserved.'

On the way up, it was Suffolk law students who worked during the week and were studying on Saturdays; there was no law school in RI then. On the way back, all kinds of characters. Likewise in the terminal. There was an especially dark and seedy bar there you could smell throughout. On occasion, I’d see some friend’s dad furtively buying something at the newstand. I infer today it perhaps offered a selection of magazines not easily found elsewhere. My friends would meet me (always late) and we would then carouse about the magically decrepit world of downtown Providence on a 70s Saturday night.'

There is no reason this building needs to be preserved, there is nothing special about it. It has not been taken care of, and when in good nick it is still an ugly building. Every thing about it screams demolition, from the badly designed and placed docking platform off of Carpenter st to the roof and guts of the building which must have to be replaced any way. This property is gonzo though, even with the recession and bad market for real estate, this building is right between the Hill and Down Town and right off the high way.

(the round building) I ride through the ground on my atv, and I can honestly say that i never feel alone. Friends parents that used to work there say there are hundreds of unmarked graves around the property. Paitents were raped, gave birth, and the workers killed and disposed of the “evidence” i guess you could say. The dentist is a whole other story. Because these kids were mentally diabled they “couldn’t feel pain”, so the dentist would just pull out teeth, an do all sorts of things with out medications. Its located in the basement of the hospital, and every time i go in that part of the building i swear i feel a sort of pain all over. The showers they were given if you could even call it that was just getting sprayed with a hose, one with enoughpressure to break your skin wide open. Ladd has underground tunnels that led to all the buildings, and one that led to a creamatorim. Like Nazi style they would burn the “useless” paitents. Its not on any map of the grounds, and none of the workers really new where it was. But i found it in the middle of the woods riding on my atv. Its just a big cement block with two chimneys. Ladd school was just a cruel and inhumaine place. You can feel it whenever you step foot on the grounds that something very wrong happened there.'

We found an opening in one of the boarded windows and thus made our entrance. However, my boyfriend at the time got a bad feeling and asked me to wait outside with him while our friends explored the dark corridors. 


They were gone for awhile and all I can recall is hearing someone scream. They all came running out soon after and claimed to have heard something dragging on the floor above them and a low moaning sound.


There was a very morose air to The Ladd School and I would definately like to go back and actually go inside this time.'

When we got in we looked around and decided to go left which we found out brings you to the mourgue. we didnt go to far into the mourgue only because we had one flashlight, but we did see all the bodey trays some open and some closed. We then turned around and went upstairs and looked around each floor(the big round building). We never heard or saw anything that could have been a ghost. If you just listen you will hear noises but use your head and you will realize that the building has a lot of leaks where water falls, and that its falling appart. Now having said that we left that building and climed in the second floor of anouther buildin, again we heard and saw nothing.After we looked around that building we left. But I do things theres something there because another time I was there with the same two friends and one more who wouldent get out of the car, and I swear to you we saw something none of us or any smart person we know could answer. Their were very long and skinny clouds reall low to the ground, they were moving alot faster than a normal clound and definatly was not from a plane...none flew over head. The two clouds then formed into an X over the big round building and was there untill we left about 10 min. later.

THEN when we went into the boys dormitory we entered through the bacement, and it was a little bit colder in the bacement than outside but not really that cold and when we were in there though we could all see our breath, it didnt make sence at first we thought it was dust, but why would it only show the dust when we were breathing? and when we were in the building there were old matresses on the floor and from the other room we heard what sounded like one of the matresses being dragged across the floor, but no one else was there. it was very creepy and i def believe that place is haunted i want to go back!'

  content: 'On January 24, 2006 my friends and I returned to Ladd School but this time not just to drive by it. This time we went inside the building. We went in through the basement window and started to travel through the main building. When we were proceeding to the second floor, a non-living person pass through my physical being and it was as cold as ice. I paniced for a moment unable to move or breathe then I was able to let out a scream to my friends who were about to turn the corner on the second floor landing and I told them what happend to me. They thought I was crazy so I kept the errie feelings that I was experiencing at the moment. Then just at the point of reaching the second floor landing we noticed that one of our friends was not near us. Just then we heard sobbing coming from the second floor. We went down there and saw our friend standing against the wall crying. We tried to get some answers as what happened to him and he was non-responsive to our request for him to speak to him for the first five minutes. After the duration of five minutes he seemed uncertain or baffled as to what was happening around him. Then after a few minutes as if coming out of a comastasis stage and having a flash back of a traumatic event he started to mumble what was going on and what he had seen. He could only tell us that he had seen a little girl in the building who was bleeding all over. I needed to see for myself what he had seen so I had him point out the room of in which he had seen the little girl. In the far right corner of the room there was a little girl roughly around the age of 7 sitting in a small chair holding a teddy bear with no eyes. Blood was pouring down her head and body. The way I hear it, this girl was not only murdered but also raped in this building and the story was covered up. When we saw this she pointed to my friend, told him to get out, not in threatning manner but I would say in a warning tone of voice because she knew we were in danger. When they saw it we ran for the basement window where we had entered the building. Upon exiting the building, my brother and I were the last ones standing in the basement when him and I heard something move in back of us. We both turned to see what it was and there was a tall, dark, and slender figure in back of us. The figure pointed at my brother and motioned to him as if it wanted my brother to follow. My brother turned around and climbed out of the window. The figure then turned to me and motioned to me as to follow it. I wanted to follow my first instinct and feed my curiosity but instead followed my brother and friends out of the window and back to the car. When we were driving away my breathing was not fogging the windows but instead frosting them with visible ice. I asked everyone else if they were able to see their breath and the rest of them said no. For most of the ride I was non-responsive to everyone but instead tried to focus on what or who passed through me. What is odd is that instead of seeing what I was trying to find, a picture of a woman in her mid-thirties clouded my every thought. I do not know who she was but the image of her face would not leave me. Then we stopped at a restaraunt and I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. In the reflection was a man who looked exactly like me but he had red hair and blue eyes and it looked as if he was trying to say something to me but I could not make out what he was saying. Now that my friends and I have went in there together, another trip to Ladd School is being planned but this time our main objective is to find the morgue. And here is a word of advice to those who plan on going to Ladd School, Bring more than just 7 people and make sure you don’t get seperated from your group because there have been people who went in and never came out and I’m sure no one has heard their story because they got seperated from the group. However I have had the honor of having some of my friends who were a part of those groups who were able to give the story of those people who have disappeared. May they rest in peace and our journey to discover the paranormals continue safely. '

The "boys" FOUND - on the property jugs of a clear liquid substance, not knowing what it was and looking like “alcahole” jugs, broke one while in the building on themselves. Two boys who were severley injured!


They entered in a window already opened on the third floor. THEY WERE SCARED HALF OUT OF THIER MINDS WHEN THE JUG BROKE, AND NEVER EXITED THE BUILDING WITH THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE DIED IF THEY DIDN’T GET OUT, AND ALMOST DIDN’T. COULD NOT FIND AN EXIT, ONE KICKED OUT A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AND WHILE THIS " SUFIRIC ACID WAS MELTING OFF THIER SKIN, THE BOYS COULDN’T GET THIER CLOTHES OFF FAST ENOUGH.


Knowing the grounds and building to which I am reffering you must know how long they had to run to the road to even drive to the ER to get help. This was property of the State of Rhode Island and if the boys drank it thinking it was bootleg whiskey, which is what it looked like, we would be looking at the death of 2 to 6 children! 


THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF VANDLES AND 5 CHILDREN WERE THERE BEFORE, WHO WRITE TO YOU OFTEN!!! TWO BOYS NEVER WENT. THAT WAS THIER FIRST AND LAST I AM SURE THEY WILL EVER SET FOOT IN THAT PLACE AGAIN AFTER BEING LED BY GHOSTS TO WHERE THIS WAS LOCATED, AND THEN IN PANIC AND SHEER TERROR BROKE A BOTTLE SPLASHING THEM, 2 SEVERLY AND ALMOST LOOSING THIER LIMBS COULD NOT FIND AN EXIT. THIS STUFF IS OIL BASED, AND DOES NOT STOP BURNING WHOLES CLEAR THROUGH TISSUE AND BONE AND DOES NOT COME OFF. EATS THROUGH MEDAL AND ANY SUBSANCE ON EARTH. JUST IMAGINE A WHOLE GALLON BRAKING, SPLASHING ON THEM WHILE THEY WERE ALREADY IN A PANIC TO GET OUT. THINKING IT IS ALCAHOLE OR WATER, THEN BURNING AS THEY TORE OFF THIER CLOTHES IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, NARROWLY EXCAPEING BY THE VERY SKIN OF THIER BODY’S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW YOU KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WAS NOT DONE ON PURPOSE. THE POLICE WERE GIVEN THE LOCATION BY THE CHILREN THEMSELVES. SO THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD GET HURT, NAMELY YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS. SOME DAY I HOPE YOU TALK TO THEM SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE REAL FACTS OF WHAT WENT ON AT THAT PERTICULAR BUILDING ON THE LADD SCHOOL GROUNDS. MOST OF RI RES. DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW MANY BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS ARE LOCATED AT THE "LADD SCHOOL" GROUNDS. JUST THE GHOST STORIES FROM EVERY CHILD WHO WENT IN AND THIS VERY SAME THING COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM.'

Me and a lot of the other students that lived there with me would always sneek off campus and go to the ladd school, the fogerty buildin,g because it was directly next to our dorm rooms. Anyway one night, kenny M, myself, Rob M, Makayla M, and Tyler who was a really interested in this kind of stuff was so excited, Josh and Ashley whom are kids who believe in spirits and ghosts were getting really antsy. We were on the third floor and my necklace broke off my neck and my cross was broken in half. kenny freaked out and rob bugged out, we left and went back to our dormitory and told some people what happened but they didnt believe it, bu ti will tell you it is the last time i ever went in there. and ive been in the buildings over 10 times, sometimes more then once a day. i think the only reason that that stuff happened to me was because i preyed before going in and everyone else didnt but tyler told me ill have something following me for the rest of my life. its really freaky.'

I remember as a child going to the Ladd School with my grandparents as they use to bring clothing for the clients.The reason being my family knew what it was like to have MR children-adults as my Aunts both were but my grandparents didn’t give them up to be treated like animals, they took care of them up until they were to old to care for them.Any feedback would be greatly appreciated about what I didn’t see although I do remember people naked on the floors.'

One of my friends (who’s name I will not mention) had already been on the inside of the Ladd institution and was talking to me about her experience in there. All of my life I have wanted to have a super natural experience with the dead. We did ot go in, however as we were driving by, instead of feeling scared, I felt the presense of a non-living person in the same car as me. I do have to admit it did freak me out a little, but what I felt with me was not that of an angry spirit but instead a scared person. At the time these thoughts were passing through my head I heard a voice saying to me “please help me. I’m in the basement, please help me”. Yes I did pick up on some bad ora with that building but I believe that there are some spirits looking for resolution to what happened to them in that building. Do I plan on returning to the building? Absolutely, and I plan on going on the inside to do some further investigating on the matter to see what happened in the basement.'

We parked the cars a little down the road and walked a dirt road surrounded by the dark woods and old ladd buildings. we passed one old brick buidling which i believe is called Greene. we passed the next building which was Doyle and then we came upon the large orange and tan building. We went through the window and there was an upside down trash can waiting for us. we all got in and we walked around the basement for a little while. we walked up about 3 floors and searched everyone of them. nothin really happend but as we passed the morgue one of my friends said shut up shut up i hear something. so we all went silent and went up to him. the wall outside of the morgue was thumping like a faint hearbeat. i was taping the whole entire thing and throughout the whole night my screen would flip upside down and would get messed up. it happend about 20 times. we left the fogarty building and headed back to the car. i was leading the way with one of my other friends and we heard leaves crinkiling as if someone were runnign in them. my other friend saw someone running through the woods in what looked like a white hoodie. we left right after that. the next day i called a few of my friends to go back up. this time i only went with a group of five. as we approached the fogarty (big orange building) one of the rooms on the second floor lit up. We hesitated to go in now and waited. About 5 minutes later another room on another floor lit up. Once again we waited. Now a blue light appeared from the 4th floor window and from there it jumped around the building. It looked like it was being shined from the outside and after about 10 minutes it stopped completely. We waited a few more minutes and than went into the building once again. We went through the same window and walked right to the stairs. we heard a gust of wind, but no one had felt any breeze at all. we kept walking up the stairs and my older brother said he heard footsteps. We stood on the the floor which we had not been to yet, dead silent. all of a sudden i heard footsteps coming from an upstiars room. we all looked at each other scared and left for the night.'

We had a dinky digital camera on us when we pulled up to, what seemed like the main building. It was rounded and eriee looking. As we pulled up to the buildings a feeling of slight terror over came us, but we continued to drive to the buildings. Until we reached what seemed like the far corner of the rounded building. I took several shots of the landscape on which the buildings lied upon. We pulled away from the buildings and somehow we decided to go back. to take a few more shots. We were at the corner once agian about 20 feet away from the rounded building. I rolled down the window to take clearer shots. I heard knocking noises coming from the forest behind us. I told Eric as he drove slowly to the side of the building to slow down so he could listen to the noises I heard a few seconds earlier. He convinced himself it was the car. He turned the car off so we could hear clearer. My window was down half way and he heard the noises as soon as the engine was off. The noises we noticed seemed like the were getting closer until they reached the building. then it sounded as if they were right behind the car. Eric was at the stage of full terror and I also panicked. Our car could not start for about thirty seconds. The sound we heard could be compared to a broom stick hitting a hollow tree. The pictures we took were very dark. But some did show some things that we could not explain. One picture of a tree facing the rounded building had a big white mark almost in the center of the tree. One other picture of the biulding had a swirl in it at the bottom left of the picture. We took a total of about 30 pictures and about a 3rd had little white marks in them. Eric is convinced thet it is his camera, but I bielive there was some type of energy lingering around the front entrance of the building. One- We felt frightened for no reason and Two- The strange noise we heard and the pictures could be some type of sign. I plan on entering Ladd School but I advise people who do try to go there, to go there with more then three people. I had some strange vibes about the place as we were pulling up to it. By the way the time was around 11:30 at night. This was my first visit to Ladd School. '

I can’t picture it, seeing as she had a mentally retarded daughter who was also in state care. I was just there in the beginning of November of 2005. I took pictures and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. In all honesty I was hoping I did. I would really hate to see it knocked down even though it may deserve to be. Its quite a historical site, and besides ,y mother, the only thing I have left of my grandmother. I would love to visit Ladd at night, the only thing stopping me is that I have a family of my own now and dont want to be arrested for tresspassing, or anything else for that matter.

We did not get very far in when the digital camera my friend was taking pictures on shut off at full battery life. When we left, we walked about 200 yards and the camera turned back on at full life again. In two of the pictures there are orbs. The same group of us also tried to go back in the hospital building last night. We were walking up to the same entrace as on halloween and we were about 30 feet away when we heard a door slam and what I thought was shattering glass but the rest of my group said was a clattering chain. We ran behind one of the other buildings and decided not to try to go in this night. We thought if we went in we would either be in there with security or another group of people, or something else which did not appeal to us at the time. We plan to go back within a day or two though.'

We took a half hour drive up there. Absolutly no street light around, nothing at all. We parked across the street so we can walk to the metal gate we had to go around. We walked up to the gate and 3 of my started to b**** out. So we started to walk back to the car and we all said “Be quiet, lets see if we hear anything”. Once we became quiet we heard a loud moan coming from the woods. We ran across the street into the car. Then we drove up to the gate and shined our head lights down the road. That road was like 1/2 a mile long, pitch black. I wanted to go but my one of my girl friends wouldnt go so i stayed in the car with her. We parked the car facing the road just incase something happened. So she sat in the drivers seat and i sat in the passenger seat. We watched them walk down the long road with their flashlights. While i was watching them go down the road, i seen a strange orange some kind of flashlight looking at them go down the road. I looked like someone was holding it, and then it went off. A couple of minutes later it did it again. So i was freaked out, i called my friend and told them to come back. They said they’ll be back in a minute. Then they just disappered around one of the windy roads. We couldnt see them no more. I was pitch black and all I had was my cell phone to keep the inside of the car lite. I turned around to see if they were coming and i swear i seen a white face in the back window and disappered. i thought it was a car light but no cars were riding by. I ducked down in the seat scared shitless. Then we were quiet and we heard someone or something running in the woods. We called them back and we heard them running. They came running back up to the car and jumped in and we drove away. They said they were hearing screaming coming out of the woods and they said they seen footsteps on the road and then they disappeared. We also saw someone walkin in the woods with a white hoody on and then it looked at them, thats when they started to run. But my friends went back again hallween night and they said that everything was knocked down. There was no more building left there. But you know that it was haunted by not even going into the place. Some scary s*** when its real.'

And when we never expected that we would experience the scariest night of all of our lives… Before we even entered the building two or three people from our group said they saw a large shadow run throw the bushes ahead of the main enterence, when we first entered the building we went threw a large door that brought us into what seemed to be a kitchen area we walked around for a bit going into the rooms then went upstairs and went down a long hallway at this point there hadnt been any “ghostly expeirences” as we walked down the hall we passed the morgue when we went in there the first time all the draws were closed as we exited one of the people in our group fell threw the floor… after that happened alot of crazy sh*t started. when we went by the morgue again to exit the hall every draw in the wall was open and there was what appeared to be body bags on each table that came out of the wall. at that point we began to move much faster as we were exiting the hall way we heard a loud sceram then sounded like it came from a young girl. It was the most horrorfying sound ive ever heard this scream sounded like a scream of terrible pain and tourment. as we were now trying to find our way out of the building as quickly as possible everything got cold the air was soo cold we could see our breath at that point the red metal holders for the fire extinguishers began to rattle and shake. The section of the ladd School that we were in was the large round orange building we could not find the exit it was almost as if it fanished we kept goin in circles trying to find our wat out and couldnt not find the way we came in it was at that point that my brother who also was terrified smashed a window with his hand so we could climb out but there was a piece of ply wood blocking the window after searching every room for a window that wasnt boared up we finally found a room that had two windows wide opened with a trash barrel upside down under it. It was as if they opened the windows to let us out. This is an Intierly truthful story chances our i will never return the the lass school unless its during the day!'

I remember the Fogarty building well, where my mom mainly worked her second shift. I remember being amazed at the building being round, I had never seen a building shaped like that before and I would run around in circles playing with patients who were alot older than me at the time but had the mind and mentality of 2 and 3 yr olds when I also remember walking the grounds playing pushing patients in their wheel chairs thinking that even though they were mentally retarded they still needed to get outside and enjoy the sunshine fresh air birds or just the changing of the leaves or maybe see the first snowfall of the season.

At the time of there employment they were allowed to live on the site as an employee benefit. After hearing stories and being told about this i became more and more curious as to what this place was like. I took my first trip to the Institution in 2000 where I collected numerous memos x-rays, cups and multiple curtains , which i have turned into a collection of art pieces. I have painted on memos, x-rays and have made some journals out of linen collected. Of course, none of which i have ever shown at gallery’s or sold because of it being illegal. I still charish and value these projects.

It started as a School for the Mentally Handicapped, but through state intervention, and a lack of insane assylums, it was soon filled to overflowing with the Mentally Handicapped, Drunks, Obsessive Compulsives, the Criminaly Insane, people who had had nervous breakdowns. It was quite a mix. I’ve been to the Ladd School at least 10 times and each time is a little different. The padded cages on the first floor of the infirmary were used as some sort of punishment. My mother says that most of the insane residents would need to be sedated, restrained, and kept in solitary confinement. The strange looking chairs throughout the building are “Shock Chairs” as shock treatment was largely in practice back then. It’s definately haunted though. I’ve seen shadows run acoss the fields, when nobody is in front of a light source. My friend had his camera slapped out of his hand and was then pushed/thrown back 5 or 6ft while he was taking a picture. We’ve videotaped some of our “Explorations” into the buildings, and upon watching the tapes, you can see strange orbs of light. Some people say it could be dust, magnified by camera, but we’ve had these things checked out, and people have said they haven’t seen anything like it. The Rhode Island Ghost Hunters have thier own show on the Sci-Fi Channel, and the guys who run it live about 5 minutes down the road from me in Warwick Neck.

Why did they have cages in the school building? If you went downstairs, the first door on the right had cages in it. While we were in the hospital building, we were slowly making our way to the third floor when we witnessed what looked like a small fire?! And finally and definately not least, around one or two in the morning we witnessed a lady jogging around the place. She came within fifteen feet of us as we hid behind a wall.

  content: 'People are calling this building a “trolley barn.” but it was much more than just a storage building for streetcars. Until the late 1930s this building and its grounds comprised the primary repair shops (called Cranston Repair Shops) for the Rhode Island Company, the electric railway company that operated over 400 miles of electric railway tracks in Rhode Island until just after WW I.


At its height, besides the Providence, Pawtucket and Woonsocket local lines, the RI Co opperated the following suburban streetcar lines: Woonsocket to Pascoag, a high-speed line to Providence from Woonsocket and slow speed (i.e., side of the road) line to Pawtucket; a high-speed line from Providence to Warwick neck, Rocky Point and Buttonwoods; a long line to Narragansett Pier and Wakefield via East Greenwich (Seaview RR); the long line to Rockland and on to Danielson, Connecticut; and lines to Artic and on to Hope and Washington via Crompton.


In the early 1920s RICo reorganized as United Electric Railways and operated the streetcars in RI until the last streetcar line was abandoned in 1948. During the 1920s and 30s UER abandoned most of the suburban/interurban trolley lines except for a handfull of Providence local lines and the North Main Street line to Pawtucket.


In the late 1930s UER had cut back so much that they no longer needed such a large shop complex. So they vacated their Cranston repair shops and did what heavy repairs needed at their Broad Street carhouse, Elmwood carhouse and the Prairie Avenue carhouse. They sold the shops building and land in the back to the brewery which then used it as a storage warehouse.


I believe that the Elmwood carhouse still exists as does the Cranston Street carhouse and the Academy Avenue carhouse. There might be another one or two of the old RICo carhouses still extant.

I haven’t been “home” in years, and these pictures of the decaying barn made me cry a little. It was such a wonderful building. There used to be tunnels that lead to the brewery across the street. This was so they could send the beer on conveyor belts to be loaded on horse drawn carts – many many years ago, and not be seen because, according to my dad, The Internal Revenue Service granted the brewery a permit to brew, bottle and sell beer and malt liquor for medicinal purposes during Prohibition. The beer had to be sold on the brewery’s premises. Sales could be in a quantity of one gallon at a time and a prescription was required. So, they would bring the beer under ground and load it onto “ice trucks” to be delivered, illegally, else where.'

Why must we destroy the Mom and Pop corner store so that mass retailers like Walmart and Stop and Shop can build over sized, intimidating gargantuan buildings which just take up more and more open space. The site of the Main building of the Narragansett Brewery (Lets not forget that at one time there was also a race track where car manufacturers would bring their newest models and race for bragging rights.) which now houses a shopping center with Stop and Shop and Kmart as the anchor stores, could have had so much more to offer. How about a museum of work and culture similar to that in the northern part of the state which could have paid homage to those who made the Narragansett Brewery an icon for Rhode Island, which could have been the central focal point of a new state park with athletic facilities and walking tracks. But the almighty dollar and the dollar signs in the eyes of J. Paolino take precedent. I realize that I may be rambling on but my dismay and distaste for people who have no regard for history and feel that we should shun the past and only support a future which cuts all ties to our past gets the best of me. I hope that we do not someday have to once again learn how to build a world from soil and trees, rather I would prefer to learn how those that did before us did it and try to maintain what they have given us instead of tearing it down. (one last note: It is land owners like J. Paolino who cause great historical landmarks such as the Brewery to fall into disrepar and allow them to get into a state of no return.)


(**A.I.R.**: Thanks for the info, Steve. Just a slight correction, the former site of the Narragansett Brewery is not the site of the current Cranston Parkade [KMart, Lowes, etc…]. That land was undeveloped until about 2000 — we checked via aerial photos.)'

It happend that we needed Narragansett Beer bar glasses for the commercial, and John MacNabo (sp), the brewery president, took me into the barn where they stored all the beer advertising paraphenalia. It was pretty cavernous, and most of it was unused by then. We took the last 8 gold-rimmed Narragnasett beer glasses out of that place, and used them for the shoot. I still have 4 of them.


We used to meet regularly in the main brewery building, in the BrewMaster’s room, which was an ornate, dark-panelled Germanesque room with a large, leather-covered conference room table in the center. At one end of the oval table, 3 draught handles stood at attention. You had your choice (yes, even at a 9 am meeting) of fresh-tapped Narragansett Lager, porter (which was really good), or ale. It’s a shame the whole place wasn’t put on the national register. It was a real piece of history.'

We ache inside to see this decaying trolley barn come down because no one cared enough to preserve our past, to remember that new is not always the best and to remind us that our existence in life has so little meaning to our unknown neighbors.


Mention the pyramid structure of the Apex building in Pawtucket and a few hundred thousand people will nod in unison.


Does everyone remember that commercial in the 70’s where it shows an Indian with a tear running down his face and as the camera backs away it shows a polluted stream? Our waterways are now cleaner because of the EPA and Superfund money. We need to have that Indian make the same commercial next to the trolley barn as it’s coming down. Perhaps it’ll have the same effect.

Anyways, we had a ping pong table set up for the film, and one of the kids comes stumbling into the room we were in during filming and collapses on the table. He had a broken wrist, so that the back of his hand could bend all the way back to his arm. Man, I hate to say he had it coming, but– Anyways, he had fallen like 30 feet inside. Not through rotting floor or anything, just being careless. His friends wanted to run away, the little pansies. But we made them call for an ambulance, and firemen came with the ambulance. 


We were going to high tail it out of there, but one of the girls in our group knew the fireman or something, so they werent pissed at us for being in there. When we saw that kid again he wouldnt talk to us. What a lil shit!'

As a kid in the 1960s I used to walk down the hill to see Reds games, Celtics games, the circus, the rodeo, etc. When the circus or rodeo was in town, they use to keep the animals behind the building and next to the wall on the south side of the building. There was a pretty big parking lot next to that with a big old house on it. Across the lot was a Kelly’s Hamburgers place. As a teenager in the early ’70s I went to concerts, public skated, and played some high school and pick up hockey games there. For about 2 years in high school I got to work at the Arena (we always called it "the Arena" or "the Auditorium")- what a blast! I got to know the building pretty well. I even got to work Reds games for a while as a "skate boy", where I got to skate on the ice during intermissions and move the goals for the Zamboni machine. I got to know a few of the Reds players and coach Wilson a little too. My best Reds memory was probably the time after a morning Reds practice when 2-3 of the workers, including me, went across the street to the Penalty Box bar (the drinking age was 18 then) with Bob "Battleship" Kelley and had some beers. A good guy and tough fighter on the ice. Kelley ended up of course in the NHL. So many memories. I miss the building and the atmosphere and characters there.'

So between that and the many ways to sneak in or sometimes just hang around by the front entrance and someone would give away an extra ticket. So I saw the Reds, Celtics, Ice Capades, rodeos (one with Jock Mahoney, the Range Rider).  I was there the night his partner during a fake fight broke his arm. I was there when a circus performer fell from the high wire into the stands.  Fortunately he only broke some bones. I remember seeing many stars like Bobby Darren. I knew many of the rink rats (kids that hung around the Arena and got as much ice time as they could. Some went on to become great hockey players in High School and College like Bobby Goudreau, Bosco (Dennis) Sweeney.  Speaking of High School hockey, all schools played at the Arena in that era with several games a night (for one admission) one after the other. Kids from all over the state went and spent the night there watching hockey, socializing and many couples meet each other that way. It was a great time.

Personally, I hated fights and never went to watch a single bout. Actually, I was too young to attend that boxing match.<br>
However, I distinctly remember the night of that particular fight (shown in the picture). After that fight family and friends came back to our home.  There was a lot of conversation regarding my Uncle Ted and the fact that he actually won the fight that night. Family and friends have contended that he won the fight, “Hands down”. For years this would be the sentiment of the folks that attended that fight actually believed he won. My Uncle never commented one way or another about what he thought!


Years and I mean many, many years later I over heard that the fight was lost because my Uncle’s family’s lives would be in jeopardy... if he won the fight. Go figure, it was back in the day and well, no need to add anything more to the point! So, so many people felt that he won the fight and this was a topic of any conversation on the East Side of Providence amid the local boxing scholars for years and years.


When I asked Uncle Ted if it was true about his family being threatened… he would say, “Marciano is not here to defend himself so I will not answer the question.” My Uncle was a wonderful and decent man! He finally realized his life’s dream when he wrote his life story and had the first copy of his book actually in his hand. The title of the book is “God’s in My Corner” and should you decide to purchase the book, remember that “Tiger Ted Lowry” was in his eighties when he completed it, and up to the last two years of his life… he could tell you about his fights and amid other interesting facets of his long life.


I was so very lucky to have him in my life. He was the second person to hold me when I was born. My dad was a tad over the limits of celebrating my birth and my mother would not allow him to hold me… LOL.


So, again, it was a wonderful surprise to see this picture here and in my office I have the same picture beautifully framed. I have had it for more than 13 years.


One final note, the man that created this lithograph attended my Uncle’s 80th birthday party in Connecticut nearly 11 years ago. My Uncle cherished that gift. He has gone on to meet his maker. He died in June 2009. He was married to Alice Lowry and she too…is a beautiful person, they were simply a beautiful couple. RIP Uncle Ted!'

I have a number of bricks from the building I aquired during demolition lining gardens around my property. I wish I could squeeze some old toons out of them !!'

My friend Jack Hanrahan and I arrived around 7 that nite, walked right to the box office and got two tickets, 6 bucks apiece.  No scalper or anything. Just imagine trying to do that for any popular artist today. Great show, I’d swear there were still notes bouncing around the rafters when the place was torn down. Too bad he’s gone. '

Merv Griffin did a special called “Sidewalks of New England” that featured Aretha Franklin live at RI Auditorium. In its final days, when half the hall had been converted into The Main Event, a very young U2 played there. And yes, Beacon Shop, just down the street, was the kind of record store that doesn’t exist anymore – not just deep catalog rock and R&amp;B, but yards of classical, jazz, blues, gospel, country, and easy listening. Throw in Korb’s bakery and Miller’s deli and North Main Street was the boulevard of dreams.'

My Dad and two uncles used to have season tickets and would bring me along twice per week. They knew one of the ticket takers at the door who would let me in for free. I used to carry and bring-in my own little folding chair and would sit in front of one of the building support columns and be next to my Dad. I even had a plastic horn which my Dad had made for me, even had a mouthpiece on it and that horn was loud! I’m sure many people had seen me sitting in front of that particular column every Sunday night and many Wednesdays. I was fortunate no employees ever threw my Dad out because I never had a ticket!


I remember seeing a live chicken or two and chairs getting thrown on the ice when the Reds weren’t doing so well. I remember several of the Reds players. Only one wore a helmet that I remember during that time (Alton White?). Even Marcel P. (our beloved goaltender) didn’t wear a face mask! I remember one particular game against the Rochester Americans where the Reds had scored over 15 goals! I had never seen a hockey team lose the game and their moral soooo badly as on that night!


The only thing I really disliked about that arena? I’ll never forget the cigarette smoke. It used to fill the arena sooo bad by the third period you could cut it with a knife!  Talk about danger of second-hand cigarette smoke? Holy crap it was bad, but seeing the Reds play hockey twice per week when I was just a kid?? It sure was worth it! Many a time in the start of the 3rd period my Dad would allow me to change seats. He knew I hated the cigarette smoke, so he let me go look below where I’d always find an empty seat for myself! I’d sometimes sit in the first row right-up against the glass!! What a thrill it was for me who didn’t even have a ticket and never thought of such things!!'

At a certain point in the 1980s Sears made a strange business decision that it would close all the free-standing Sears complexes in the USA. It would only continue to operate the Sears stores that were part of large suburban shopping malls. While many could argue that this saves on marketing, because other stores help bring in the customers, it also appeared to be another anti-urban decision by a large retailer. Even now, Wal-Mart’s approach is to begin thinking about urban areas only when the rural and suburban markets are saturated.


In the mid-1980s, some of my friends bought their first suits at theAndersen Little. The underground bowling alley was open long after the Sears complex closed. The combination of duckpins and the small bowling balls is something that is extremely difficult to find these days. This is a unique aspect of New England culture that has largely disappeared.'

The Sears I worked for was a by-gone era... the department stores that have survived did so by moving into malls and amalgamating their personalities with that of those stores around them.

It was a great job, but a crazy time to work for Sears in hindsight, because it was when the retail giant took some really big chances that did not pan out. Sears closed its catalog, overdiversified in financial services and real estate, began selling other brand name products through Brand Central, tried to convert underperforming community-stores into HomeLife specialty stores [furniture], and then started accepting other credit cards besides Sears and Discover. Anyway, now that they cleaned up the old Automotive, maybe they will do something with the main store. Between that and Anderson Little, it looks pretty bad. That area has a lot of history, the old Lowes Drive-in and, way before that, the [Cyclodrome]({% link _property/cyclodrome.md %}), which was where the drive-in was, became the first spot to host an NFL game under lights [Providence Steamrollers vs. Chicago cardinals], Chip’s underground bowling alley, the list goes on.

  content: ' “Joann’s Silver Top Diner” was a part of the ”Holy Trinity” of late-night greasy spoons when I was a student at Brown in the early-mid 80s. (The other two were Haven Brothers and The Silver Truck.) Many a time did the Silver Top save me from going to bed drunk and hungry, instead of just drunk. One night, we showed up at about 2 am, in a group of about 10 guys, 10 of whom were wasted and 4 of whom (including myself) still had on costumes and makeup from a goofball fraternity ritual earlier in the evening. (We looked like a cross between the band “Kiss” and Marylin Manson.) After engaging in our usual ritual of debating, in front of the waitress, whether to order large sodas or smalls (both were listed on the menu, but we could never perceive any difference in the size of the glasses), some cops came over to our table, and asked, in a menacing tone, what was up with the costumes. Even AFTER they had explained to us that some costumed ex-con had robbed and pistol whipped a gas station attendant in the neighborhood the night before (it was late October, and Halloween was in full swing), my even-drunker-than-I-was friend started getting all agitated and blurting out “Miranda” this and “4th Amendment” that. I kicked my friend in the shins and calmly explained to the cops that we were just your average drunken college kids doing sophomoric, stupid, but relatively harmless college kid stuff. They let us go, we proceeded to enjoy our foot-long chili cheese dogs, and I ended up becoming a lawyer. I owe it to the Silver Top for discovering that I had it in me.'

Prior to the silver and chrome structure transported from New Jersey in the late 30’s, there was a wooden diner owned by he and his father. My family all worked in it — as I was growing up — it was, indeed, a bustling place for a unique mix of society — there were the produce workers from across the street (where my father purchased fresh produce daily) — I learned to pick the best melons as I accompanied him — factory workers from Brown &amp; Sharpe, Armour meat company, and Executives who enjoyed good home-made food.  I’d worked the busy early-morning shift  (summers- I was still in school) and at 11:00 could sit down for a great breakfast — fresh homemade corn and bran muffins — and the best coffee in town. In those days we had our own baker, a Portugese gentleman, who made fresh homemade pies. Each day the diner had a different lunch special — Thursdays was New England Boiled Dinner and Fridays had delicious Mattahan Clam Chowder. I remember my Dad coming home one morning (having worked all night) and very excited as Louis Armstrong had stopped in the Diner with a bus load of his enterage traveling on Tour. My Dad owned the diner for about 30 years. I always wondered what happened to the gigantic neon sign with yellow top as it was missing AFTER the John Baeder painting. Seeing pictures of the diner is like seeing pictures of the home you grew up in. I spent so much of my childhood there — waiting on customers.'

  content: 'Sad to hear the Silver Top’s moving out of Providence, but glad it has a new home in Pawtucket. Back in my carousing days (the mid to late 90s) the night wasn’t over until I stopped at the Silver Top for a huge breakfast. When the diner hit its peak in the early morning, every stool at the counter was occupied; late arriving friends would squeeze into an already crowded booth. The jukebox would come to life. People would shout orders to the (amazing) wait staff, and they would shout to the cooks. It was very noisy. A line would form at the door. It was always almost chaos. But somehow seats were found for everyone. Your cup was filled with coffee. The kitchen didn’t explode under the pressure, as you almost feared it might, but sent you your food, exactly as you ordered. It was rarely not hot, and always good. Part of the Silver Top’s appeal to me was the oddball clientele someone mentioned above — rockers from Lupos, night-owls, frat boys, gays and drag queens, students, downcity “characters”, and who knows who, or what, else. In my experience everybody got along pretty peaceably. It was only the drunks or the occasional rude customer causing a problem. I forget the name of the Silver Top’s owner at the time but I always admired her skill at running the place, and wished her success keeping the doors open in the teeth of so much upheaval, with Providence Place going up and the old markets adjacent dead or relocated. It couldn’t have been easy. Around then the crowd I ran with decamped to the Seaplane on Allens Avenue, closer to the clubs we went to. We went less and less often to the Silver Top. My days of drinking and clubbing, and big breakfasts, were over.
  

It seems ironic (and ill-omened) that the city that invented diners is in its so-called renaissance uprooting the Silver Top, forcing it to join its sister, the Modern Diner, in Pawtucket. So many of the places that kept the city alive (well, barely) in its Medieval Era, are being pushed out, shut down, moved to the periphery; in the way of the next new, essential parking garage or luxury condo heliport. Well, no good deed ever goes unpunished. If those small shops and alley bars and live music clubs hadn’t stayed behind, making not only noise but money, when every other business pulled up stakes, Providence might still be known as that place you drive through to get to Cape Cod. Cities evolve, like everything else. But I cling to the belief that a city is, above all, an open, not a gated, community, belonging to anyone who wants to work and live in it. After a good early start remaking downcity for everyone’s benefit, now private interests seem in the saddle. What they’ll make of the city remains to be seen, but I doubt the result will be anywhere near as welcoming and open to all as the Silver Top. I think I’ll like the new skyline, though. '

My 90-year old mother’s, uncle, Albert McEachern, was an East Providence artist and, according to his obituary, he painted many murals in homes, churches and other buildings in East Providence, including one in the East Providence Masonic Temple. He also painted a mural in the Second Baptist Church in East Providence in 1939, which was dedicated to his wife, Florence A (Bayers) McEachern. I know that the church is still there, but is now a Russian church. I am planning a trip to Providence in Sept. and would like to know if anyone can help me to determine if there is a Masonic Temple in East Providence that would have been there in the 1930s.

On closer inspection, I could see that it was all graffiti from the inside of the original structure! I later noticed similar prints throughout the hotel and in the room I was staying in. It looks like the old WAS preserved within the new after all!'

Ever since driving by on the high way in Providence for my first time i was wondering what this place was, what it used to be, and why isn’t any one fixing it up . But now that i see you guys are working on it, I am happy. But I wish you guys kept the old look of the buliding. I am not a person who likes big change. Call me nuts that I am 13 years old, and usually a thirteen year old doesnt like stuff like this but I do. I know that i am only one person but i figure I give u my idea. It may be too late since u have already started on it but what the heck. By the way my dad is a general contractor with a company named JMGINC. and his company is worth about a half a million dollars not that big but he does have over 400 customers. His name is Jefferey Giusti Senior. Thank you for your time and i am glad that u guys are finally doing work there.'

I later went to check it out and decided it was to be my next playground. The amount of people and stories I have about that place are far too many to mention here. Its sad to see the place go, I heard the city was considering saving some of the walls that had graffiti art on them, but I doubt that came through and chances are they would have saved the crap ones and nothing done by the kings of P-dence. Its nice to see some of the pictures of the work on this site. I will sorely miss the Masonic Temple, but its about time the graffiti scene moved.'

You had to climb up the edges of the stairs, as the metal in the center was either gone or rusted paper thin – I can remember a few of us going knee deep through them. It was such a beautiful building once you got up top into what felt like the bones of an auditorium – the moonlight streaming in through the holes in the roof. An amazing place, and peaceful till you realized that the holes above you corresponded roughly to the piles of concrete debris on the floor all around you. Nothing ever came crashing down while I was in there though. 


There was a creepy building next door at the time that we’d gone into once or twice. Some sort of residence with lots of rooms and twisted hallways. It always felt like you were gonna find a corpse in there – seriously. Made the brave move one night to open one of the refridgerators in there. Unbelievably it was still full of food, though it was long past the point where you could recognize anything that wasn’t labelled. 


Now when I say the place was twisty, I mean that once I got in there I could not find my way out at all. Me and a pal had to heave something through a window on the second floor and scramble down the roof.'

I remember going into the building with some friends, marveling at the huge LAC that marked the back and feeling my way over piles of debris to the stairway. Then climbing up the rickety stairs until we got to the top floor. There is not an inch along the walls not covered in graffiti and the humongous top floor was astounding. We tried out the rope swing that hangs from the skeleton that was once a roof. We had to be careful to only swing from the end with the elevator shafts because if you swing from the opposite, and higher, side you will have too much slack and go crashing to the floor as my friend did. Before you know it, the train tunnel is going to be turned into a 200 room 5-star hotel. RIP temple (the real one at least).'

My father was a graduate of RISD school of architecture and was a devotee of the Frank Lloyd Wright style of Modern American Architecture. My father was extremely proud of this design because he was given the freedom to design a building that would be an architectural statement as well as a utilitarian headquarters for what was at the time a progressive and thriving company. The Bauhaus Movement in Architecture from which this design is an offshoot is no longer as Chic as it once was. It breaks my heart to have someone describe this building as ugly. I grew up in a redwood house that my father designed which was very much in the Frank Lloyd Wright tradition.

I think it was an attempt to shame some of the teenagers who weren’t able to read yet... I kind of resent this now, as I’m sure most of them probabaly wanted to kill this snotty little precocious kid reading his dinosaur book. My dad also helped me build my Pinewood Derby cars for Cub Scouts in the woodshop there... a positive memory... and I became the inheritor of some of the contraband that was confiscated from the some of the kids... but, even then, the place had an air of gloom about it.

There were so many possiblities for something truly unique and beautiful to come out of it - something that Cranston desperately needs.

Today I came across this site and was astonished at the bits of information of possible torturing of the children and now bones discovered. I think that due to the possiblity of this place having some sort of terrible past there should be more research regarding the matter before continuing contruction.

My family and I (wife &amp; 5 children) lived in the supt’s house. Our youngest daughter, Jeanne, was christened in the chapel on the grounds by the Catholic priest (forgot his name) whose parish was in W Warwick. Bill Gaulin was the mainstay of the staff of the training school. He and his wife and children lived on Sockanosett Rd in a very old, white house. Bill was not happy when I became supt because I was a liberal and he wasn’t, at least he pretended he wasn’t. I had to go to a meeting in NY one day and called Bill in and told him I was going to be away for 4 days and would he please take care of the kids. He said, “I suppose you want me to give him candy!” I said, “That’s about right.” I knew what he meant and he knew what I meant and from that day on we got along famously.


We had two Picards, father and son, working as Youth Supervisors. They too came from W Warwick as did most of the staff. Old man Picard, as he was know, had a beautiful German Shepard Dog, when she had puppies he gave us one whom we named Princess. She was a part of our family for 14 years, a great dog. Many memories come flooding back- I have a lot of stories to tell-by the way, one more...


I was away one evening giving a speech and there was a little “to-do” with one or two of the boys. Ray Palmer, Sr. Supv now deceased, a great guy, called our house and asked for me. My wife said I was out; he then asked my wife what he should do about the situation. She told him she wasn’t the superintendent and that he should call back around 10 pm and talk to me.


I am very pleased to see the improvements being made to the old training school.'

If it were anyone else that tried to domolish it, we’d be in big trouble if we pulled a stunt like he did.'

Living that close to a combination rat factory, crackhouse and public toilet is a definite drag.

There should be a revision of how long buildings can sit vacant... to prevent people from buying them, encouraging them to rot beyond belief, then knocking them down w/o any real reason. That funeral home already has a TON of parking, and there is plenty of space on the side streets &amp; Broadway. Our view from our back window was parking lots straight to Broadway. Parking lots do nothing for the character of a neighborhood... but then again, neither do funeral homes.'

I would like to speak for the people who really care about the children, and the health and safty risks this building poses to the public. What if kids are in there palying arround and the floors let go!! What if a girl is rapped in this vacent building!! What abouit drug deals, and drug user!!! there are many signs of drug usage in this building. If this building has done nothing for 30 years than take it down before it takes someones life.

I feel that all of the negativity from the community regarding the school caused all of these problems for the family to the point where a brother is no longer with us (Solely my opinion). The stress must have been so much for Stephen Tarro that he had no other out. Who cares about the old school. I remember living in Rhode island with one of the sisters and visiting the funeral home and looking across to parking lot to find homeless people and crack heads breaking the windows to climb in. Let’s talk about what is ok! Do you really want that in your neighborhood? All they wanted was a parking lot so that they could move on with their lives and be able to accommodate your family and friends when a loved one passed away. Do tell the real reason why this has all happened!! Pure envy. Everyone in Rhode Island is to preoccupied dabbling in everyones business instead of trying to make the world a better place and helping your fellow man. let the Tarros do what they need to do. They have been through enough. Now go on your way and leave them alone and Oh, mind your own businesses. I blame the people of Providence for all of the demons that surround the Tarros.'

I moved from Boston, where I taught in a school that combined racial and socioeconomic diversity with academic rigor. Providence’s schools are not serving Providence’s kids.

  content: 'I’ve just learned that this school had an unfortunate “surprise attack” of sorts. The owners, without a permit, started demolition and no doubt distroyed it before someone had the good sense to call the proper city hall reps to the site to stop work on the demo. I understand that this building has had a rather bad recent few years with all that “Roger W.” stated below but common sense should tell you that this building is NOT better leveled than rehabbed. If rehabbed properly, the property values around this location would go UP! While some regard this as tax trouble, others regard this as a good investment made better. I have seen these sorts of buildings razed for other plans and the result is always awful! The architect of today is not given the tools to make a building as beautifull as this. This is something that can ONLY be made prior to WWII. I have always said that if a building cannot be made again in the same style without a 9 figure grant, it shouldn’t be torn down! Historic scenery enhances a place. Why more people don’t understand this, is baffeling!? I understand the owners have a business nearby that requires more parking and that is why they want to erase this piece of history and fine example of a bygone era in architecture. Where I come from, we call that squandering and selfish. Pure and simple. Many years ago I tried in vein to do what I could to save the Manton and Fruithill Avenue school but was uncomfortabley way out of my league. It was demolished in 2002 and is now the site of a very unattractive 1 story building. Why anyone would want something like this to happen again is unimaginable. We as a city need to support groups like the preservation society so that landowners like this do not destroy our beautifull landscape one bad idea at a time. I beleive the penalty for this infraction of demo without proper permission is $500 a day. Is this a joke? I knew it would be low but what kind of arrogant land developer wouldn’t ignore this and rip into it if it may cost $500 a day? This is an outrage. The very first thing that should be done is to raise that amount to something that would be quite inconvenient. That cost wouldn’t deter even the poorest of developers. This website is invaluable and I want to thank the webmasters for making a difference in our landscape. If it weren’t for people like this, we’d be living in a very different kind of world.'

The owners (the demo team) say they were requested to demolish it by Theresa(?) Tarro of Miami FL but no demolition permit was issued (the building inspector for the city came this morning as did the Mayor). It is being watched by the police 24 hours a day. It seems that the Tarros figure that now they have got what they want. The building is damaged so it can be condemned and then torn down. First neglect then damage then poof, they’ll have a nice parking lot. Somehow this doesn’t seem right that historic buildings and a city-owned former school can be put into the hands of these sleazy owners who screw the neighborhood from Florida and who don’t even live in the neighborhood they’re screwing.

If that is so then I can understand why they would want it for parking and I can’t fault them for it, especially since I would not comment on people I have no personal interaction with. I recently (1/29/07) received an email that demolition is about to begin and that the pipes are being removed in anticipation of the demo. It is sad because I really would’ve loved to turn that into a unique home one day (the property value is under 200k and even 200k in renovations would still result in a beautiful and unique home under 400k in a great neighborhood). But, like I said I can’t fault them for wanting to increase the parking in the area since it is tough to come by and especially if they operate businesses on Broadway.

  content: ' Unfortunately the fate of this beautiful building follows a national pattern. Very many of my generation, the baby boomers, have forsaken their history and cultural heritage to pursue materialism and ego, and worship wealth. With that, wondeful historical structures like the Grove St. School will fall to the same effective underhanded tactics, which is to send the historic buildings into disrepair and even intentionally damage them to induce condemnation. The shallow disregard is made so very clear with the “eyesore” and “jealousy” comments from those who hold no value on their history and culture, and only see their own ego or personal gain as the main priority. I wish the best to those who have not forsaken community values and wish to preserve these structures. It is wise for all of us to hold our elected officials responsible in being proper guardians for these public properties. The Grove St. School, like many, was likely sold to pad public coffers and offset some red ink, but no regard for the fate of this historic structure was included in this sale. I fear these wealthy owners will likely win in this battle as they destroy this beautiful piece of history for their own gain. As the old saying goes, there are no rich people in heaven.'

First of all, Richard Tarro was and is (as you are well aware, he is deceased) one of the most generous and kindness men that I ever knew, next to my own father. You obviously did not know this man who gave so much to the Federal Hill community, Holy Ghost Church, the elderly and pretty much any human being or four legged creature that came into contact with him. His selflessness stood out when he was alive and is still praised to this day by all that knew him. He loved this neighborhood as much as he loved his own family and friends. Mr. Tarro, as well as his own father was a State Representative for the area and had only Federal Hill’s best intersts at heart. He was a stand up guy that put his name to anything and everything that he believed in and his children are and will continue to do the same with their Family business and in their own lives. As for the “Tarro Boys”, obviously you do not know them either, because ALL the Tarro children, not just the boys, share the same generous, selflessness traits that both their parents passed on to them. I have always been told that jealousy is the root of all evil, and it could not be clearer that it centers your world. To try to deter a family business that has been in this area for well over 80 years from growing and developing with the rest of the Federal Hill area, is simply just JEALOUSY.'

You used to be able to enter from the back of the building through a busted door and go through what I believe was the old cafe. The Tarros are jerks, always have been. The father if he is still alive was the biggest a-hole. It’s a shame to see them ruining the building to get it torn down. I hope the funeral place down the street puts them out of business.

Cruise ships could dock people who wanted to shop could take the new trolley line into the city to shop and eat in the resturants. After people have been on a ship the want to get off and explore a city. After a while they get tired of being on a boat and want to see other things. It would be a great start for the waterfrount. Other investors would then want to build there, and that would keep the money in the city. Building in the suburbs and distroying suburban neighborhoods is not where the casino should be built. Look at the Sidney opera house, it is the image one thinks of when they see a picture of Sidney. This would be the beginng of the waterfrount and help it to be developed.Let them pay to clean up the polluted soil. If they are going to spend millions of dollars it should be there.

Oh, those overheated radiators were tough), and my brother helped Zam with car repairs in the shop. The place was like a Barney Miller sitcom — we had many “old guy” visitors such as “Smitty” (Yankee fan), “Old Pop” (Red Sox fan), and of course, “The Chief”, a Narragansett Indian who also worked with Zam during the winter and would visit in the summer to teach us how we could survive in the woods with a nail and a piece of string! It was a neighborhood with many African Americans (we were Italian) at a time (late 60s and 70s) when there was a lot of tension between blacks and whites — but many of our customers were black and we all got along so well — it shaped the person I am today, and I am proud of that.'

From there we moved to 4 Whelan Rd Apt E. By then there were 5 kids in the family. I remember Billy Donnelly and all the things he mentioned above of course! Billy was a CPO before he joined the PPD. I remember when the Roger WIlliams College Students came when I was about 13 and set up in 2 Whelan (375 Hartford) to study us in our environment... and most of them were kind and did alot for us. Larry DiPetrillo, Dennis Dobbyn and his sister Phyllis, Calvin Drayton, Carolyn, Ed Skahill, Billy Eggers, Chuck DeVecchio, Fred Hibberd and many more. As for fellow “inmates” I remember The Irwins, Gomes, Parkers, Moores, Martinos, Irons, Lavallees, Rileys, Peckhams, Salisburys, DeSanos, Malletts, Lazeaus, Espositos, Perrys, DiSimones, Cravens, Cadys, Cabanas, Champlins, Deals, Giblins, Hanleys, Ealeys, Malos, Dragons, Bennets, Gadagnos, Skip Fenner, Mikey Royales, The Adamonas brothers, Linstroms, Meyers, Chico Monez, Bertie Souza, Albert Sliney, Michael O’Rourke, The Dougans, Obriens, Hazards, Smiths, and so many more if I really push my memory because I was there for so long... probably until around 1974 when the family finally moved. I can’t say my memories were all that great. We all witnessed some strange and occasionally brutal things growing up inside and outside our apartments. We learned a lifestyle that was best forgotten as adults I guess. What can I say?'

I ran fearing debris and dust would violently envelop  us ( mother and sister ). To my surprise, looking over my shoulder, the structure’s descent had ceased.

  content: 'My grandmother lived in one of “the big buildings” in the Hartford Projects during the 70’s. My family lived about one hundred yards from her in one of the ”brown“ buildings. As a child I spent alot of time with her as she grew older. Initially, you could just walk into the building and either climb the stairs to infinity or push a button and take the elevator. The whole building was made of rebarb enforced concrete. Every two apartments shared a 6&quot; x 12&quot; concrete porch with a green corragated plastic sheet which covered the chain link fence to ensure privacy from those below. My grandmother used to like to sun bathe on her lawn chair with her iced coffee by her side. Her apartment (also concrete throughout) was always styling. You would never smell moth balls when you walked into her pad! She always had the latest and greatest furniture and decor of the day and the place was always spotless. She had current pictures of the family on the walls and of course there was the religeous pictures which hung in every room. I believe the only thing she had that was “old” was a picture of her mother, which sat in a “current” frame. Then of course there was the neighbors. Mrs. Early down at the end of the building, who would waddle her way up and down the front catwalk, snapping her gum with the three teeth she had left and looking to strike up a conversation with whoever was willing. Mary Weston, who lived a few doors down had a million stories to tell about her life and the people in it. I would sit in her apartment and listen to her stories and she would feed me. After my grandmother died I would still visit the folks at 22 Whelan Road. It made me feel a little closer to the memory of my grandmother and I still loved to hear the neighbors re-runs. There were alot of people who lived in the apartments of all four big buildings. They all had a life, a history, a story to tell. And they all mattered. As they all died off they left their legacy within the halls, walls and stairwells of those big buildings. And now... it’s all gone, as if none of it ever mattered.  '

In 1960, my family moved from a cold-water tenement (2 bedrooms, no hot water) to this building, apartment 6L. We had 3 bedrooms, one for the 3 boys, one for the 3 girls, and 1 for my parents. The building was a hotbed of crime at the time and got worse after. But I was VERY happy to have grown up in that housing project, and to this date, 46 years after I moved in, I am still friendly with many of the similarly situated neighbors. I look on my 12 years living in the project as WONDERFUL. I worked in 2 nearby stores, Bills Variety, and Lanes Spa, and also worked in Joe’s Shell Station. Those jobs enabled me to know EVERY resident of the project, with hundreds of apartments. I went on to work for the police department, and retired in 1989. The building, VERY well constructed, took 3 months to demolish with a swinging ball. Every apartment was replaced by what is called scattered site housing, much better modern housing for our lower income fellow citizens. '

In a city that has many homeless families it was much needed then as it would be now.

The building dropped a certain number of feet… and then rested, without fully imploding. We all kind of just stood there, mouths open, shocked and waiting… nothing further happened. Guess something had gone wrong with the wiring of the dynomite, not fully enabling it to implode the building. They eventually had to demolish the remainder of the building manually. It stood there for quite some time before fully demolished. I used to visit an elderly woman there, and also went to school across the street at Oliver Hazard Perry. '

I also recall that Providence was listed in Newsweek as one of the “Hot Cities” to live in, and the mayor saying something to the effect of “We live in one of the hottest cities and we’re blowing up buildings.” I also remember my great grandmother living in that building in the early 70’s, when the dominant population of the buildings were elderly people.'

My cousin Joe, Bob, Paul, Ed, Bruce, and I spent almost every day either on the midway or at the pool in the summers of 1962-1966. One of our mothers would drive us to the park, give us couple bucks and would pick us up around 4. The pool took a token worth .50 and Sue was always there to let us through the turnstile. What a beautiful girl, we were all smitten. We were 11-12 and she was 15-16, always wore animal skin looking bathing suits. Enough of that, we would swim and listen to pop music piped over load speaker systems, it had a three tier diving board, we would dive off the first two but that 3rd one was way up their. After a while we would leave, get a hand stamp to get back in (from Sue) and either go on the midway or jump on the trampolines on the water front. The midway was a great experience to observe and walk, sometimes stepping on a lit cigarette butt barefoot not fully extinguished, ouch ouch, they had rides, penny arcade (yes using real pennies back then) and food vendors, but best of all side shows. I remember seeing a Freak Show, that was real strange, a guy looking like Buffalo Bill pounding spikes into his head, up his nose, through his lips, and not bleeding. I could go on and on but what I wanted to say also was my very first job was at Rocky point at the World Famous Shore Dinner Hall, busboy. $1.20 per hour. I just retired after 49 years of working and I owe it all to that first job. '

I can remember my dad taking us on the Wild Cat and rocking it at the top before it dived down. We were so scared, but we went on it everytime. Eating in the Chowder House was like nothing I’ve ever experenced before. It was HUGE. People just sat near each other and shared bowl and bowls of chowder and cakes.  We were there when it was not crowded and I remember  sometimes waiting to get in. I have a picture of me and my dad at the Rocky Point Bar with hats on and holding up empty bottles of Falstaff. We took my sister’s first boyfriend there with us. She was about 15. I remember her boyfriend prucking all over the place on the Spider. My dad and I were laughing. He had to buy a shirt. My sister got one to match. When I was dating my husband, we use to go there every weekend and walk around. He would fish off the rocks and I would sunbath. We’d eat chowder and cakes to go and just hang. When we had kids, we brought them there every weekend also to sit on the rocks and eat, or go into the park. It never mattered to them if they rode the rides or not. Sometimes we would just hang out and people watch. The House of Horrors was my favorite ride. Onetime we were watiching fireworks on the grass and we were so close the cardboard from the fireworks were coming down around us. It was so cool. Thank you for this blog.

I can remember at the end of the nights in the summer, the counting room for all the money was in the back of the redemption center, after all was counted my uncle (who did the evening drops at the bank) would pull his car up the midway and they would load bag after bag of money into his old dodge until the back of the car almost was dragging to the ground! I went there yesterday (sunday the 4th)  along with lots and lots of other people. What a disgrace this, to have let this beautiful and historic part of rhode island fall into disarray I sat an creid yesterday afternoon just looking at what had become of this treasure. It was like being in a movie and so surreal. You could almost hear the ghosts of all the people in the wind... Rocky point was such a special place, it should be reborn into something special that everyone can use and enjoy!

  content: 'I am so excited to have found this site. My husband and I spent the day at Six Flags a couple days ago and I found myself talking a lot about Rocky Point (he’s not a native Rhode Islander). The memories were so strong that I had to Google it yesterday and I ended up here. I read other people’s memories and I was so overcome with emotion and nostalgia that I couldn’t stop crying. Rocky Point was a HUGE part of my childhood. My dad used to take my older sister and me, infrequently at first in the mid 70s when we were just little kids because at that time there were other parks he’d take us to as well, like Crescent Park and Jolly Cholly’s, then we started going more frequently in the late 70s, early 80s. We’d go practically every Sunday in the summer, sometimes every other Sunday, back when they used the different combinations of the colored string bracelets with the colored jaw clasp to designate admission on the different days. We couldn’t wait to hear the jingle on the radio because that meant that school was out and Rocky Point was open! Dad had an El Camino then and on some days he’d let us ride in the back and we would jabber the whole way about which rides we were going to go on, and how we were gonna ram each other on the Bumper Cars, and were we brave enough to finally try the Enterprise?  I remember sitting in traffic that would sometimes start a mile or so back from the entrance and we would practically be jumping out of skins with anticipation and excitement. We would be crawling along and be so happy once we passed the “Rocky Point” sign and got into the park. We’d ride the Musik Express and be so happy when the DJ played a song we liked. We would watch the Tilt-A-Whirl to see which car spun the most and then we’d grab that one. I’ll never forget how scared I was to go on the Enterprise the first time only to realize how much I LOVED it and would ride it countless times after that. The Cyclone was one of our absolute favorite rides and we must have ridden that thing 10 times during each visit, I can still remember how my stomach would flutter when we flew down that first hill.  How we loved to ride the Flume only to scream if we got too wet or the water was too cold! And I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizza! I remember one time my sister was playing the ring toss game because she desperately wanted to win one of the big stuffed bears, while I impatiently pleaded with her to stop playing and ride the rides with me, which she finally did.  At one point, we got off one of the rides (I think the Musik Express) and there was Dad holding the bear she so wanted so badly! He had played and played that stupid game until he won it for her. Dad would finally say it was time to go, and we would PLEAD for just one more ride, usually the Musik Express or the Cyclone. When we got older into our teens and my sister got her license, we would go with our friends and then it was all about riding the rides and noticing BOYS! This was mid-to-late 80s and the park was still always packed and we would still sit in traffic to get in and we would STILL be excited to ride the rides! In the early 90s, I would go with my boyfriend or my friends and it was still fun, but not as much. I’m not sure why that is, maybe because there was a different crowd of people that started frequenting the place. Gone were the days when Dad could sit on one of the benches and read the Sunday Journal while his two young daughters would safely roam the park. Also, some of it may have been that I was in my early 20s and at that age, you are in such a rush to grow up and enter adulthood, I think maybe you start to disassociate from many things which symbolize your childhood, which RP definitely did for me. Anyway, I think the last time I went while RP still had rides was maybe 93 or 94, I was with a bunch of friends and I’m ashamed to admit that I may even have deemed the park as “lame”. The very last time I was there was October 98, there was some Halloween-themed event going on (which really WAS lame), and that was it. Maybe about 4 years ago, my husband and I went to visit some friends who live not far from RP and I wanted to drive by to see what was left. When I saw the sign in disrepair and looking so, I don’t know, ignored and unloved (crazy, I know, but that’s what it looked like), I burst into tears. You don’t really begin to treasure precious memories until you are older and more mature and have a broader, wiser perspective on things, and nostalgia sets in. Now I’m 39 and my dad is very ill, which rips my heart apart and makes me cry very easily. Reliving these memories is both exhilaratingly wonderful and terribly heartbreaking. The knowledge that Rocky Point is gone and the fate of its property in the hands of greedy soul-sucking developers is bad enough, but I hate that treasuring these memories occurred so belatedly, after the time has already passed to fight for RP’s survival. I wish it was still here. If I close my eyes, I can still see us sitting in the parking lot in the back of Dad’s El Camino, eating clam cakes and throwing the scraps to the seagulls.'

Ill never forget it. My dad was in charge of all the games and the redemption center. Jeremiah F Leake, my grandfather was in charge of the main office. My brothers Jerry and Brian worked the midway. My sister Angela worked in the office. My sister Maureen was about to get married and reside in maryland. As for me [Kathy] my twin [Karen] and our brother Kevin and our beautiful Mom we visited almost everyday. We could ride any ride we wanted for free because we were Jerrys kids. Everyone knew who we were, we got away with nothing.The flume water ride was forbidden, to many accidents. Ill never for get the fire works on the 4 of july by the water. The best!!!!!! My dad told us to stay away from the gypsys b/c they would steal us. My dad just did not want us to go to that side of the park. Who Knows! I heard that gypsys wanted to buy my dad when he was a baby. Maybe thats why he said that .Ill never know. My dad Jerry DiCapua died on July the 9, after working 4 of july weekend in the park at the Family Kingdom in Myrtle beach,SC. The amusement park was his life, his love besides my mom of 59 years. Everyone who knew my dad LOVED him as his family did. He was funny,smart,handsome and had a quick left,and a right. I am sure he was a pain in the ass every now and then. [right Mom]. I miss my dad sooooooo much,you cant imagine. Rocky Point Park will be in my heart 4 ever, as well as the clam cakes.'

All of my friends and both of my sisters worked there too. When I started the wages were $1.30 per hour and you could work as many hours as you wanted. It was really good money for a kid at the time. I worked in the food stands because I was underage and could not work the rides or the games. I landed the job as the shift manager at the cotton candy stand and all of my friends made fun of me because it was a sticky job and you always smelled like candy floss. I just grinned and barred it. The stand was right at the outdoor stage and I saw every band and stage show that came to the park. No one bought cotton candy during the shows. I was great. As a local kid we knew every way to seek in. There were holes in the fence behind the House of Horrors and up in the woods at the top end of the flume. I wonder why no one ever fixed them. We used to sneak in after the park closed and look for money that fell out patrons pockets under the Music Express. We always left with some money. I also remember the salt water pool with the high diving platforms. It was a lot of scary fun for a kid. You don’t find anything like it now. I also met my first real girlfriend there, her name was Tina. I saw her walking down Tidewater Drive (near the park) years later and she had grown up to be a knockout. Stopped and said hi and then went about our lives. It is saddening to know that it is no longer there and never will be a'

I can best describe my experiences at Rocky Point as “I had a blast”.  I practically ran from ride to ride so that I could “fit” as much as possible into one day. I remember getting sick a couple of times, vomiting in the barrels. The tossing and turning of the rides didn’t always agree with my eating plenty of the shore dinner. Even with that, I had to practically be restrained to keep me from immediately running back to the rides. Rocky Point was like a heaven for kids. When I was there, I felt like “this must be heaven”, it was the greatest! Even as an adult, it seems to me that it is a part of my childhood that I shall never outgrow, the scarier, the faster, the more challenging the better. I was deeply saddened to learn of the park’s closing, such a loss to not only Rhode Island, but to New England. I miss Rocky Point, and I wish they’d bring it back! I think they should build a hotel somewhere on the grounds with a view of the ocean. Hotel guests could take their kids to the park to bring in more heads. Rocky Point was a landmark, it was a great part of RI, I for one sure would like to see it back!'

My grandfather’s famous phrase when we were kids was: “Do you guys want to go to Rocky Point?”  We eagerly said: “Yes!” His response was: “Then start walking!” LOL. Man, all I can say about RP is that it felt dreamy going there as kids. I visited last when I was 18-19, just prior to it closing. I had thought about it many times over the past 20 years, but just recently my lady and I were in the Warwick area. Being that she is not from R.I., I took her there and I was very disappointed to see how the entrance was locked up, along with the many signs reminding outsiders to keep out. It made me just really want to cry seeing one of the only theme and amusement parks in this state just go complete bankrupt. You would think that this state would just fund the park for the good of all its residents. Frankly, RP is a landmark and will always remain a landmark and a place where memories will never be lost. Let’s petition for it to come back or something. I wonder what would happen if we parked the car and went in. Very macabre like, but very indulging at the same time :)'

My father ran security at the park from the middle 70s (after Eddie Silva, Warwick PD) until the late 80s. May of you will remember SGT. then LT. Jim Godbout from the Warwick PD. We thought that RP was our very own playground! I remember coming through the gate, getting our hand stamped by Mr. Ferla or Mr Casciolli(sp?). Conrad gave me my first job at the shore dinner hall in 79, washing dishes with big Jim Kelly, and learning to make clamcakes with Julio. I will always remember the words “CHOWDER DOWN BOYS”, that meant we had to carry one of those steaming cauldrons down to the takeout window. In 82 I went to work for the games division, and my summers were a blast! I met more girls than you could shake a stick at! I even ran the Whack A mole game when they brought it in. Being a gamer at RP was a blast. I continued working there until 84 when I graduated from Hendricken, and joined the Marines. My sister, Lori Greaves, and her husband Jeff, had their reception at the Windjammer. Do you remember Agnes? I miss that tough old bird! She use to smoke unfiltered Luck Strikes! The last time that I went to the park was 1987 with my wife. She had never ridden a loop coaster until the corkscrew, and will never again. She was 6 months pregnant with our first son, and she was shaking so bad that she could not stand up to get off the ride. So as I look at the pictures of what is left of that wonderful place from my childhood, it fills me with great sadness. It is a shame that another generation will never get to watch the fireworks from behind the office. Get that first kiss in the house of horrors or enjoy that special Rhode Island treat of clam cakes and chowder. And to all of our friends that are still up there, Jim, Kathy, Jori, and Jon are all here in Charleston SC and doing fine. I can be reached at retailtuna [at] yahoo [dot] com.

I ended up spending the summer working with a lot of others from England, France, and various other European countries (Hannah, Sarah, Berengere, Dave, Paul, Mark). We had a blast! They housed us down in the dorms at URI and bussed us in every day. It was a non-stop good time. Oddly enough, I don’t think I ever rode any of the rides. I worked in the Kiddieland area. I was planning to go back for a visit and came across this website saying it’s closed... bummer. I live in California now and would love to hear from any others who worked there that summer.'

So I’m in RI to visit friends and we took a drive to Warick on July 27, 2008 (2 days ago). It was nearly dark and a light rain coming down. The dead end of the street was dark and eerie and as we approached the entrance we saw that the entire cinderblock sign was in rubble on both sides of the gate. VERY creepy looking! The 2 overhead streetlights were there but not lit up. The entrance was almost completely overgrown and you couldn’t see anything! A car slowly drove by us and someone yelled out “Go ahead... go inside... it’s ok”. Are they NUTS??? NO WAY! I took several pics, a chunk of painted cinderblock, shed a few tears and was on my way..

Conrad Ferla never shot or ate the pigeons. The pigeons where a nuisance, they roosted on the rides by the hundreds. At the time that was the only safe way to rid the Park of them. Remember, we are talking of the fifties and part of the sixties...'

I was so scared when i was a little girl but as i got older i knew it wasn’t true. I went in there over and over again. I use to go on the spider but not very many times because i didn’t like it when it went around and around. I use to get sick as a dog when it went around. Then comes the bumper cars. I use to love going on them several times in a row. Then it was the Skee ball. I loved getting all those tickets and then cashing them in and getting prizes. The skydiver was fun too!!! And then comes the rockets. I use to love the rockets. I rode them over and over again. I loved to go high in the sky as a kid. It sure was fun. Then the musik Express and boy did it go fast forward and then backwards. I loved it. Then the skyliner after you go on the flume. It somewhat made you dry from the sea air. You could smell the sea air up high in the sky. It sure was fun. On hot days you go on the flume just to cool off and get dry on the skyliner. What a way to go!!! I loved the train ride just to slow down a bit. What a shame that this family playground is all gone. Those are great pictures of the park but it’s not the same. I sure miss you Rocky Point.

We took  buses there, the school had packed lunch for us (subs, chips, soda) which I remember eating outside the park in the lot near the Corkscrew.  I remember being completely immature and there were porta potties near a cliff and while my friend was in one we all started shaking it and she started screaming.  I remember spitting at each other while riding on the swings. I remember loving the Musik Express and the Flume. The corkscrew was fun. My favorite ride was the Free Fall, which kept breaking every two minutes. I remember one or two times it broke while we were on it. That ride was so much fun.  I remember one ride which was this little car that was on a ferris like wheel. You’d sit in it with another person and there was a wheel you could spin that would make the car spin around. I got so sick in that! I nearly lost my lunch! That was the only time I went there. My neighbors went many times with their family. It’s so sad that it closed.

She would stamp the hands of the swimmers as they would enter the pool pavillion. I remember watching Billy Ross on the highest driving board, he was stricken by electricution and lost both arms. He had one stub, but after he dove, he could still swim to get out of the pool. Anyone who saw him, could not believe it, what a sight. I also was a summer resident of ROCKY BEACH every summer from the Fifties, with my parents, Grandparents, and the BEST of all, is where I met my BEST FRIEND in the world, LINDA DEQUARTTRO! She is still my best friend to this very day. We have been friends for at least fifty years. We  would go to ROCKY POINT as little girls, and sit in her mother, Artea’s ticket booth for hours. She was the HEAD cashier, at the MAIN ticket booth, in the center of the park, next to the CASTLE OF TERROR. We could not it for the day that we would be old enough to work there. My sister Doreen Stephen also worked there, with her best friend JANET CHAFFEE. By the way Janet, i read yor anecdote, and it was wonderful that you mentioned Doreen and I. We can also remember all the Fourth  of July’s, watching the best fireworks ever,  on the beach near the pool. It was fabulous. At the time we worked at the park Mark Scala was manager and before that it was Conrad Ferls. He would ride through the park, on a motor scooter, checking things out. We had the time of our lives. I will never forget it. The concerts, I rember JANIS JOPLIN for free!! And i will never  forget the free acts, the best being THE ZACCKINIS, ANNON BALL as they out of a cannon that was attached to truck, into a net in the middle of the MIDWAY. WOW what a sight !!! Living so close to ROCKY POINT, at  ROCKY BEACH  was the best. Linda and I would walk to work, and home every day and night not caring how late it was, we would walk through a path at the end of the parking lot near the batting range, right into her back yard. My father Al Stephen was the caretaker of Rocky Beach, he loved it so much there, as did my mom, Rita. I can not believe that it is gone now. How could the city let this happen to a most beautiful area in the entire state. These memories are instilled in my heart , and will be forever. LONG LIVE ROCKY POINT PARK. I SURE WILL MISS YOU. '

I would sit in his car as he would do his rounds. In 1976 I began working there in the maint. dept. Everything i learned there came from my godfather John and his nephew Alan Ferla, who to me was an older brother. I remember how Alan and i used to love playing jokes on his brother Conrad. I also remember one particurlar joke Alan and I loved. We would drop some really smelly liquid, it smelled like rotton eggs and as people would walk by and smelled it we would laugh at there reaction. As a kid in those days i never thought Rocky Point would ever shut down. I wish Vincent Ferla never sold it.'

I was an English student at the park working as a Foods Supervisor for the summers of 1989 and 1990.


I stayed in the big scary (and we thought haunted) house for the first year, just outside the park, and the boys were in beach houses just across the car park. The second year I lived above the main office… my room was kitted out with an oven, microwave and really was a home from home! I remember Nancy LaVoie, Pat Costello and Jerry who were also supervisors. Cheryl used to work in the office… everyone was great to us students!


We were treated like royalty... mainly because of our accents &ndash; and most of us spoke the best english ever whilst we were there!


I remember the night when Sam Fox played… we all cringed… she was a nightmare from home… but really big over there then… Guns and Roses also came and quite a few big acts &ndash; we always wanted to work on the beer carts on the nights when there was a band playing as you could make a fortune in tips… although I think again a lot of that was due to the accent!


I remember we all used to go to TeDens the bar at the end of the road after work, and it was brilliant… the parties in the dorms were fantastic and I have so many photos and happy memories of when we all worked there.

In those days it was fine to hitch a lift, and I remember quite a few times we got lifts to Stop and Shop for supplies!


Working the ice cream stand was brilliant &ndash; and depending on who served you you’d get a tiny cone or some great massive ice cream covered in jimmys!


Ben and Jerrys also had a stand there in 1990, I used to go with Pun Pandya and open the gazebo and we’d have ice cream for breakfast &ndash; it was just being launched then… I remember going to Newport and seeing it in a shop there and at the time we thought that was pretty amazing… now Ben and Jerrys is everywhere &ndash; you can get it in every supermarket over here now… and it always reminds me of RPP!


They were great times, doughboys, chowder and clam cakes, salt water taffy, sloppy joes in the canteen… all these things were new and fab for us! Years later I was in New York and drove to RI to visit RPP… only to find it had closed down… it was so sad… Amazing memories… fantastic photos and great friendships!'

I remember my WORST memory of Rocky point was back in the mid seventies. My mom was a school bus driver for Smithfield, and there was a class field trip for either the junior or senior high school students. My little sister and I had to go along. We spent the whole day OUTSIDE the park, because my mom didn’t want to take us in (probably because we was po’ folk back then). Yup, the WHOLE day, outside in the parking area, watching the rides. It was then that I truly understood the concept of Purgatory.


My first job was at Rocky Point, in the Ice Cream stand. I was working there when one of the managers tried to burn it down in the &lsquo;80s. I loved the House of Horrors, and we used to get out of the cars and walk around scaring people. I can still smell the clam cakes in the Shore Dinner hall.


The people of RI deserve to have that spot preserved for future generations to enjoy with their families. It would make a great waterfront park for picnics and family get togethers. We all know what will actually happen, though, don’t we? Well connected cronies will get theri claws into it, and it will be lost forever to us. To add insult to injury, they will probably get State money somehow to do it. So sad.'

I believe it was the second party thrown there. The rave was called CAMP EARTH and people were there from all over the world because it was an amusement park rave,something virtually unheard of. There were a little over 18,000 people there. The very best house,trance,breakbeat,jungle,and happy hardcore d.j’s were there, from around the globe. The rides ran all night and the wind jammer and the paladium jumped all night until about 12:00 pm the next day. Prior to that I used to pedal my bike from Providence just to get there. My favorite ride was the corkscrew rollercoaster. It’s very sad to know that a place with such a intense vibe is no more, but Its effect on me and the memories will live on.   '

All we had to do to get to the park was walk through a path in some tall grass. We went to the pool and park on a daily basis. We would search the parking lot for admission bracelets and slip them on. One summer the park just started giving us free admission. I remember being so disappointed when the pool closed. The cottages and park were a great place to grow up and I am very sad to see them go. My kids will not have a chance to be the 5th generation to grow up there. I wanted to do something my own style to remember Rocky Point so I wrote a horror movie and started to film a little around the cottages but it was a late idea the last summer we were allowed there and I ran out of time. I will miss Rocky Point like I miss my great grandmother and wish my kids could have enjoyed both. '

A friend of mine introduced me to on of the parks manager (John Ferla) and he asked me if i would link to work for him in kiddy land (or as we old timers know it... the beep beeps). Thats when my life changed . I worked not only at kiddyland but also had the chance to run the house of horror, ..jungle land.. the car that you actually drove, that was fun... the cars would run out of gas or the engine would stop and one of us had to run to the other side to get it started or end up pussing it back to the guarge area.. Then i ran the Roto Jet ( which was located on top of ona concession stand. . In fact while i was reading some of these letters that the people wrote i reconize some of the old timers . Carol Strang ...if you read this i just want to say hello. You were describing the house you lived in and it does bring back memories. The night we all would close down our rides and head to oakland beach . We were called the twin eagles because a lot of us had motorcycles . We had a special table that we sat at.. Yea...old memories....Beach parties and girls. John Ferla would walk around the park checking on us and every once in a while he would yell and say ( in italian accent) ...Fuster boy Fuster. I grow up really having a lot of respect for that man. Then there was the times that his brother Conrad would drive thru the pakk with his big RED caddy and that plate will always be in my mind. RPP ! . Joe carusso (the maintaince man went around the park from earley morning till the park closed repairing the rides. When the power went out in the park we had to react fast to stop our rides in a safe manner and get the people off, Then i would go over to the ferris wheel and help the operator there. The wheel couldn’t turn so while he worked the cluth i would climb the outside of the wheel and turn the wheel . so many memorise and not to mention my first really love...who i lost because i was young and stupid but i still think of her after 40 years.

Kix 106 threw these concerts with a variety of acts at once. I got some autographs there, too. Too bad I didn’t have a camera back then. Didn’t get to bring my son there for he was too little to go on anything before they closed the park down. I loved the Corkscrew, Tilt a Whirl, Music Express, a d the Rock N Roll. Those are classic rides. The House of Horrors was funny just to go through. Those were the days. Unfortunately, this state doesn’t have anything else. You have to travel to surrounding states to an amusement park. Weird Al Yankovic played at RPP years ago, along with Stevie B. The Flume was one of the best rides there on a hot summer’s day. Don’t even have to go on it to get wet, just stand next to the fence. So long, RPP, you will be greatly missed. '

Later on in the summer of 73 I worked there starting out in the Castle of Terror and ending up on the “Crew” of the Zyclone. We flew “bombing missions”. Mrs Woods would save the big mustard and ketchup containers for us that were then filled with water. We would time the cars so one of us was in a car above pouring a sheet of water in front of an unsuspecting car. There was no way out. People would get off the ride more soaked than the Flume and thought it was part of the ride. They thought it was great! Many run-ins with Alan Ferla who was always bailed out by Conrad Sr. Many more stories abound!'

We got stuck at the top and my Dad couldn’t stop the box from spinning and I was screaming and they couldn’t get the ride moving again for like 10 minutes, it was so scary, but I also remember thinking how strong my Dad was and how much he loved me trying to keep us safe. We never did ride that ride again. But we continued to go every year. Once I was old enough to work I had my first job at the park working for the games. I had so much fun. I still have a frog leg and a ring from two of the games that I treasure. This is truly sad and will be missed. I feel like a large part of my childhood is gone.

  content: 'One of the finer points of my chilhood has vanished, though quite expectedly. My parents owned a cottage on Common Fence Point where we spent our summers. It was a common occurance for us to visit Lincoln Park, Crescent Park and Rocky Point every year. Being an incredibly innocent child, I remembered how terrified I was just seeing the House of Horrors. The dragon with head in claw was especially scary to me. I remember thinking, “If that’s on the outside, what’s hiding on the inside?” That was the summer of &#8216;72 when I was 11. A few years went by and as a graduating 8th grader, my middle school took us on a field trip to RP. I finally made it throught the H of H and laughed at the comparison of what I had dreaded might be inside to what I actually saw. But no matter. It was fun just the same. After that, my trips to RP were less with my parents and more with friends. A few trips, here and there, every year. But it was in 1983 that RP became an important summer ritual. I spent EVERY weekend at RP. Sometimes on Saturday, sometimes only Sunday, but for the better part of the summer, it was the whole weekend. I remember the Fixx playing one night. A particularly favorite band of mine at the time. As the years went by, you could see how they weren’t managing the place properly. One year, it was free admission and you payed for your tickets at the kiosks. The next it was charging admission just to get it. The next it was free admission again, but the ticket prices were comparibly outrageous. At the same time, you never knew what rides would be there from one year to the next. I was fortunate, however, to get my two boys to the park the year it closed. One more time of enjoying “a place for family fuuuuuuuun…” I took many pictures of that final summer. I’ve not been back since it was closed. (Too afraid of being caught trespassing). But from what I’ve seen here, maybe i’ll walk down there one more time, even if there’s nothing left. It doesn’t matter. As many of us can attest, if I stand there, among the weeds, cracks, debris, graffitti, and bits and pieces of our past, I’m sure I’ll still hear the sound of the Music Express, the girlish screams coming from the Rock-N-Roll, and I’m sure there’ll be a lingering smell of dust, diesel, popcorn and sea air. Maybe I won’t… but I’ll remember it.'

My earlist recolection of the park goes back to the 1960’s as it was considered a amusement park for grownups or more appropiatley kids who considered themselves grownups LOL as we felt that we had outgrown &quot;CRESCENT PARK&quot;.From the flume to the roller coaster it was all very new to us. Then in 1975 I got my first job there working the &quot;SKOOTER&quot;with a friend as we took turns switching sides alternating from taking the riders tickets to being the guy who showed them the way out after the ride ended and untangling the cars that were stuck in positions that the operator could not get out of themselves. Then in 1976 I was operating the &quot;HOUSE OF HORRORS&quot; when as per ususal there was a rock concert on the old midway stage next to the &quot;ROCKY GAME/GIFT, SOUIVNER SHOP&quot; and a unheard of band from austraila AC/DC was playing that night. Most of us know the band nowdays because of the onstage antics of the lead guitarist &quot;ANGUS THE SCHOOLBOY YOUNG&quot; and it was a rather dead night on the rides as most of the people there were watching the concert. I took the 1977 season off due to a better offer from another job but in 1978 I was right back there operating the &quot;ROUNDUP&quot; and the &quot;ROCK AND ROLL&quot; rides but a lot of us could see the writing on the wall as often we would go hours between riders and even the game operaters noticed a decline in buisness even on traditionaly busy friday nights and weekends. Then as summers went along we heard about the &quot;CORKSCREW-LOOP&quot; ROLLER COASTER being built and they were going to add a proper stage for concerts on the midway near the &quot;FLUMES&quot; BIG DROP HILL and that we were going to get a &quot;FREEFALL&quot;RIDE. But even with all the new attractions including a &quot;ROCK &amp;ROLL REVIVAL SHOW&quot; with legends of rock and roll &quot;THE TOKENS&quot; the &quot;SPIRAL STAIRCASE&quot; and even &quot;TINY TIM&quot; performing the crowds returned for a while but as quickly that they returned they were gone and rumors started being spread that layoffs would be happening and that the park was having problems paying its bills. So I started looking for a more stable job and I never worked their again. Then the news about the park closing it’s doors for good confirmed all that we had heard.And then the fires and vandalism that has stricken the park just tears another peice of my heart off along with the news that the idea that housing would be built at the site of the park is in limbo make my pain a little worse.I was against tearing the remaining buildings of the park down but after seeing pictures taken recently I feel that even though a lot of rhode islands residents have very fond memories of &quot;ROCKY POINT PARK&quot; we ther they worked there or just enjoyed a day or weekend there It’s time to close the book on this part of rhode island history and finish the job that MINDLESS, THOUGHTLESS VANDALS have started. thank you very much.'

But today I did a quick search and found this website. It brought back many fond memories of the two summers I worked at the park. My friend, Christian, and I lived above the main office building. We were in charge of distributing tickets, collecting cash and bringing change to all of the ticket booths in the park. It was by far the best summer job I had. We each had a Yamaha Razzee scooter that we would whip around the park in doing our collections and deliveries. Sometimes we would take the scooters “off-road” over to the Rocky Village area (I forget the correct name) or bomb around the park when it was empty. Super fun times. I especially enjoyed “teaching” the lucky (or unlucky, depending how you look at it) kids sitting next to me on the Freefall how to push up on the safety bar a bit and lift your feet during to freefall to get a better sense of falling. Everyone that worked there were great people, I forget some names now, but David, Angelo, Jimmy, the office gang and everyone else were incredibly friendly people. Thanks for the quick trip down memory lane.'

  content: 'One of my favorite of all places was Rocky Point. We’d drive there on a Sunday afternoon, enjoy some chowder and clam cakes in the shore dinner hall and then off to the midway for rides and fun. One of my favorite booths was the dog racing booth; I spent hours there and remember the man who ran it had a cocker spanial who sat ther taking everything in.


When I got older and drove myself again it was a fovorite place to go with my friends in tow. I miss Rocky Point and am sorry for what is happening to one of the most wonderful places on earth. At least I have my childhood memories of family outings to remember.


Long live Rocky Point! '

You can always remember the smell of all the clamcakes and chowder.. and you cant forget the sweet smell of cotten candy.. You can always remember every year when school got out that soon you would be there.. looking out your car window for that famous sign saying in big letters ROCKY POINT.. then your heart would beat faster because of the antisipation of running to that first ride... So many happy memories.. not enough time... wish someone had reopened for all the new generation to see what a great place it really was.'

Although I am a boat owner, there is nothing more enjoyable than being able to take a walk and sit by the sea. In the early 80’s I would scuba dive there for clams with my buddy, whose dad was the president of the park. The amount of shellfish along the shores in 3 - 5 feet of water was staggering. I can remember one day diving under the dock for little necks. I think i got about 600 lbs of clams in a couple of hours. More memorable were the artifacts that I collected that day underwater. I still have the silverware and the plates from the old shore dinner hall. I also found everything from thousands of AK47 bullets in clips, to gold chains, telephones, a mortorcycle, coins, even a visa gold card. I believe the DEM would dump confiscated shellfish at the end of the dock. Lucky for me I hit the mother load. Now that I have children, it seems shamefull that good old Linc Chaffee allowed this gem of the sea to go to private hands. Seems like there is no regard for tradition in this date. Rocky Point, Brenton Tower, Crescent Park, whats next?? 


Today the main building burned to the ground. It was scheduled to be demolished at the end of this month. Pretty coincidental eh? '

  and I was just thinking about the ld park so I did a search online and found this site. It’s really nice to be able to share all these feelings we all have about the park. I love that place so much. So many of my childhood memeries are there beyond the surrounding fence. I used to frequent the saltwater pool as a kid in the early seventies with some friends during school summer vacation. My mom and dad used to take me and a friend or two about five times every summer and I took a girl there on a date in 1983. I’d been there after that date but as I got older I went much less. In fact my memories are only from my very young years. As a child I cherished that place. In July 2003 my friend and I squeezed through a hole in the fence to get one last look, take pictures and in some way to say goodbye. I have those pictures we took but they are quite sad to look at. Thank you to the people who put this site together. Great memories revived.'

I was petrified of some of the rides there, especially the Free Fall. I remember my sister was in the Woonsocket High School band, and they played for President Bush when he was there and all I wanted to do was go explore the park. It was so much fun! The last time I went there was with the Boys &amp; Girls Club in 1995 and it was pretty dead, so all the lines were very short. I took it upon myself to finally ride some of the rides I hadn’t had the courage to ride earlier (though I never did ride the Free Fall). Of all the places I looked forward to going during the summer, this topped the list.


The ride I think was the most fun was the one where your body was only held in by centrifical force. It started spinning on the ground, and eventually would tilt completely vertical like a ferris wheel. I’ve never seen a ride to this day that operated like that one — at least not one that inverted like that. I miss Rocky Point so much!'

The years i cannot remember. But my mom was one of the original cooks in the old shore dinner hall right on the water! My dad worked there also but i dont remember what exactly he did. We lived many places in Rhode Island. But the one place i remember the most is right on Palmer Ave around the corner from the back gate. Cursey’s bar was just about in our back yard. As a matter of fact it was in our back yard! My mom and i and my sister and step dad lived in a 2 story house. it sat right next to another 2 story house. We were right across from Rocky Beach. This might jog a few memories too. We had a big garden and at one point we opened a vegetable stand and grew and sold our own stuff. What we did not grow, we would go into providence to the farmers market and buy stuff there to sell! Ring a bell yet? Well it had been years sense my mom and real dad had worked there. But when i got old enough i went to see John and Conrad Ferla and they gave me a job in the ticket booths. What a blast i had. I even met my first sweetheart or 2 there also!. I espicially remember one in particular! I loved my job there! But before i was old enough to work i remember going there and hanging out and i used to get alot of free rides. I got to know alot of people. I used to go ice skating in the winter on the small pond behind the pool. Of course i used to swimn in the pool too. Gosh there is so much to remember. Seeing as i lived on Palmer ave till i left home at the age of 20 to get married i had alot of time in Rocky Point. I remember the big old house on the hill also where a certain family lived. I remember the girl named Mary who my sister hung around with and i believe i hung with Marys sister! i have over 20 something years of memories. I did manage to bring my first born child there, just before they closed. my mom still lived on palmer ave at that time. I still talk to some friends of mine who lived in the other 2 stoory house next door. We have remained long distance friends over the years. They are also a part of Rocky Points past. It was funny after the park would close a whole bunch of us workers and friends from Rocky Point would head to Oakland beach for Guss’s greasy hamburgers. That place is another story. Long live Oakland Beach! I could probably write a book of memories of these places. They were the best years of my life. Now i have been married to the same guy for 35 yrs and we have 3 beautiful girls 2 of which are married. The youngest just turned 18. We also have 4 beautiful grandchildren. ages are, 2 boys are 9 and 9. Two girls are 13 and one is brand new = 2 months. I wish rocky Point was still open so i could bring them there for a good ole fashioned outing. My moms house still stands and i visit RI every couple of years. I now reside in pensacola florida.with my family. Oh yes my brother who passed away last yr also had some memories of rocky point. My sister too, but not as many memories as me! Oh yes the blue danube bar right outside the gate is where my sister had her wedding reception! our mom catered the event. My mom was also a caterar and alos owned the cozy coorner restaurant in warwick with my dad. Anyway THOSE WERE THE DAYS! just some actually. '

Rocky Point was our playground 12 months out of the year. We started going to the beach in front of the salt water pool during April school vacation. My brother Robbie’s first job was cleaning up after the elephant act. My brother Gary’s first job was at the salt water pool. When i was 10 I babysat for the palm reader’s four year old son for a week or so. She paid me off in ride tickets. The first thing we would do is go on the Tilt - A - whirl because the centrifugal force as the ride sped around would force change out of people’s pockets. We would reach down behind the seats and collect the money. Then we would go to the candy store at Rocky Beach, the summer colony right outside of the park property. My mother grew up living in the big white house, known as the Rock Cottage, on the ledge behind the shore dinner hall. My grandfather, Antonio DeRosa, was the park caretaker when my mom was a kid.

Theres a flash from the way back machine. Rocky point was a great place to work as a kid. I was 14 working in the shore dinner hall, started with dishes and wound up doing just about any thjing else they wanted you to do. I worked for the father Conrad who gave me the job because my two brothers before me worked there. and if they left a with a good work record thats all you needed. of course you had no identity except for your last brothers first name. Thats the way it was then. The days were long, some times 10 hrs and if there was something going on at the jammer you got a little more. Everybody was part of the big familiy.esp in the kitchen where Big John ran most things and Old Manny made the chower every day what a process that was. I used to help but just by bringing the the things he needed . Like 10 gal of potatoes 5 gals of clams and so on. Also Jack was another cook who was in charge he mostly worked on the clam cakes and parties. We had some big parties Try serving 2000 Teamsters over they’re week end. alot of watermelon. Thank god for billy rizzo this kid could cut melon like a machine and just as acurate. My God I have So much more and will never fit here. this was just the food part but i also work in thepark on rides an games. This was the summers of &#8216;67 &#8216;68.

  content: 'Amazing to read this- lots of memories! I too worked at Rocky Point in games from 1969 
to 1974 to make money for URI. I could net over $1000 a summer and URI’s  tuition was $565! I remember Mark Thompson mentioned above. The Ferlas  ran the park and a number of semi-and formerly famous attractions were  brought in - Frank Sinatra Jr., Sly and the Family Stone, the Flying  Wallendas, Marlo Thomas, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, etc. 


MRB Enterprises was the company that ran games and was named after three people from Hershey PA: Mel, Ronnie and Beatrice — real low lifes! Jerry DiCapua, the son-in-law of Mrs. Leake ran all the games and employed his three kids, Jerry Jr., Brian and Angela there too. His faher-in-law ran ROCKY , the bingo place. 


But I had a great time those summers where I worked all the games but took over running the Greyhound Racing game where I made a lot of money working lots of hours (92/week) for college. I can remember collecting over $5000 in quarters on one of the big days (July4th, Labor Day)! I can still remember all the dogs names after 32 years! (Big Wig, Mike Ike, Stacey, Hacker, Shifty, Maglass, Regain, Elect, Hurry Ivan, Tivoli, Bill Me, etc.) My three brothers worked with me (Eddie and Neil worked concessions and Mike ran the Cliff House) and I met and started dating Liz Burke, a sister of one of the guys I knew who ran the Break-A-Dish stand, Kevin Burke. After hours we would all go to the Cliff House where the band, the Coachmen played and drank underage (Mike was the bartender). Liz once turned down an invitation from Gary Puckett to go on the rides with him! 


One last note about the Break-A-Dish stand — you didn’t want to work ther on the day you had to shovel out all the broken dishes! They weighed a ton! Funny thing is that RP taught me how to speak in front of people and here years later I often speak before large audiences without giving it a second thought about being nervous! Guess calling greyhound races and guessing peoples’ ages and weights on that hot midway with a scale and a microphone paid off! Liz and I married in 1974 and now live in South Carolina, the proud parents of three grown children.'

  content: 'I first came to Rocky Point on summer Friday nights during the 1960s. The Providence Evening Bulletin — no one I knew read the morning Journal — had these little ads for the park squeezed in among the movie ads. “Ride all the rides — $1 — 6 p.m. to closing.” Even my cheap old man knew a bargin when he saw one.


So several times my parents, my three brothers and I would pile into the ’63 Chevy and drive the 10 miles from East Greenwich. We loved the Dodgems and the Skyliner, and yes — more than once we jumped from the ride at its summit and walked back to the midway like 20th Century Huckleberry Finns. I’ll never forget as we left one night, my Dad complaining: “That evening cost us $22!” Guess they got us on the food!


We never were allowed to play the games, which is why I guess I was intrigued in the spring of 1971 when a buddy called me over to his table at the high school library. He was reading the want ads in the paper, and pointed to one looking for kids to work the games at Rocky Point. “MRB Enterprises” was the name of the employer — by then the rides, games and food stands were all run by different corporations

it was the beginning of the end.


But I didn’t know it, and spent five glorious summers at the park working the games. My first summer I earned a princely $1.60 an hour. While there was no overtime, working 80 hours a week could bring a kid a fairly fat paycheck. The job could definitely be a grind — especially when it was 90 degrees or more in those booths facing west into the setting sun. It was worse at the “Break-a-Plate” — break, chip or crack any two plates with one 50-cent baseball throw — because of all the dust. There was usually one 20-minute break a day. But once a week a bunch of us would go out for dinner after the park closed to Gregg’s, Gantry’s, Arthur Treachers… those were really fun times.


I met my wife-to-be, Diane, who worked with Mrs. Leake — everybody called her Gram — where you turned in the coupons you had won at Skeeball and other games for amazingly lousy prizes. I didn’t fall in love with her until I learned her Dad, Jack Gould, had actually built the Castle of Terror (sometimes known as the House of Horrors) and the Wildcat. That kinda sealed the deal for this midway maven.


We’ve been blessed with two sons, and were lucky enough to be able to take them to Rocky Point before it closed. Every time and place has a time and place that defines growing up, and for many of us there and then, in post World War II Rhode Island, that place was Rocky Point.'

His assistant’s name was Al. As a child in the 60’s, my grandparents and parents would bring us to Rocky Point once a summer. I remember a ride called The Tea Cups. I also recall the Funhouse and that I was always afraid to ride it. Through the 70’s and 80’s I would visit the park at least once a year and I witnesses many changes including new rides and also a change in the crowd. In my early years at the park it was a family oriented park but as the years progressed, the park became a hang-out for teens. The Friday and saturday night rock concerts didn’t help. I also recall some of the Midway shows including a human Cannonball and also a high wire act. 


At the time I worked at Rocky Point, a bar called Cursy’s was open just outside the exit road. Co-workers and I would gather there after work for a drink and a game of pinball (an old Star Trek machine) or, we would drive over to the old semenary on Warwick Neck Ave. and sit at the stone wall looking over the bay. 


I no longer see any of the people I met during that time but I recall some names. Tim and Bill were entrance booth guards and Rick was the train engineer. The “floater” who made the rounds to all the rides and provided 15 minute breaks to the operators I can remember well. I don’t recall his name but he had greased back black hair and in fact, I saw him many years later working at BJ’s in Coventry at the gasoline booth. I also recall Conrad Ferland. He was the Head Honcho there and I can still picture him driving though the park on a small Moped type motocycle. We all behaved when he was lurking. 


As a parent, I took my 2 children to the park on several occassions prior to its closing. My daughter was always a daredevil... even at a young age and wanted to go on all the rides even though when she stood against the wooden cut-out of the boy who said, “you must be as tall as me to ride”, she didn’t quite meet the requirement. She would stand on her tippy-toes in a desperate attempt to ride the Corkscrew or Sky-Diver. 


After the park sadly closed, we bagan taking our children to The Enchanted Forest in Hopkinton for a few years. I believe that small park in still in operation today. Going there was a sad reminder of the closing of a historical gem... that being Rocky Point Park. It is sadly missed but brings on so many fond memories of days long gone by.'

From my bedroom on those hot summer nights I could hear the joyous screams from the rides, the barkers at the game stands and the music over the P.A. system.

My fondest and clearest memory of Rocky Point was riding the Corkscrew for the first time. It was the first time I ever rode a rollercoaster with an inversion. I’ve been addicted to them ever since. My mom had to hold me in the car with her leg because I was still pretty small, but I still remember how much fun I had. We rode it 3 or 4 times that day, and many more times in the future. I wish the park was still around, so I could experience it as an adult, and so I wouldn’t have to drive to Agawam, MA to pay 30 dollars to get into six flags.'

The Osmonds were the big group performing there at the time and I can still remember thinking that was so awesome and that I could not afford to go and see them.

  content: 'I share alot of memories of RPAP as a visitor as well an 3 year employee of the park from 1989 though 1991.The pay was really crappy no matter how many hours you worked. I was too young at the time to be a ride operator. This saddens me to see the park is gone for good and not even a faint sign of redevelopemnt.


In 1990, after my 16th birthday, I was working the food stand #4 (by the bumper cars) from open to close. I was sent out on my first 45 minute break around 3:30PM that afternoon. I get up to the employee lounge order my lunch and take it out side to enjoy the fresh air and picture perfect day it was. I sit down under the apron when a guy who was a ride op starts talking to me. He mentions to me in our converstion that he heard a rumor a kid who worked in the park rode a bicycle from Providence to the park for work every day. I replied to the guy. “You don’t say?” He said well, that is what they tell me but I’ll tell ya this though, the kid must be in the shape of his life. I chucked under my breath a bit because I was that kid he was refering about. I rode a 10 speed bicycle every year back and forth to work. Was working about 18 - 22 miles a day (pending what year) and I could get to the park faster on the bicycle then a car could taking the highway from Providence. Well, I finished my lunch and go to throw my trash away and walked over to the guy who made the comment about the kid cycling back and forth to work on a bicycle. I looked at him and said, “So what do you think, you think I can keep this shape the rest of my life?” He just stopped dead what he was doing and just looked at me. The guy was stunned because of the fact he thought what he heard was a rumor and nothing more. I still had some time left on my break some 30 minutes or so, so I walked away to lay on the hill and grass just to soak up some sun, listen to the cars drive in, the seaguls crow and the ocean crash on the shoreline. Then it was back to the grind at stand #4. Working with me at the park was never a dull moment. I always made it fun to work with me at the park no matter where I was at.


But in the three years I worked there. This is the most vivid and startling memory I can share with everyone. I was shocked to find out I was the talk for the park for two consecutive years but did not know it. My thrid year I would only ride the bike to work if something was wrong with my car. But as for keep the shape I was in back then the rest of my life. Unfortunately, no I did not. For health reasons I could not ride a bicycle again, even to this day. In June of 1993 I moved out of RI to Ohio, and my family told me the news about the park problems in 96. I denied it until my visit of December 2000.


I just started college and I was on a two week break visiting family and friends. I had gone out with a very good girl-friend of mine dancing for the night. But when I got back home, I was too energenic to sleep. So I asked my baby brother if he wanted to go for a ride. Sure he said. We ended up at Oakland Beach just a stones throw from the old park. It was nearing sun up. And I could not resist. I parked my out of state car just off to the left of the main gate on the lawn. We proceeded to take a final look at the park. I needed closure or something. We walk down the entrance drive and the first gate was open where they let the trucks and delivery vehicles in (by the apalo and stand #1). We walk up the midway slowly bearing right all they up to where the Corkscrew used to be. When I saw it had been burnt down I was about to burst into tears seeing all my memories have been demolished. My baby brother saw I was about to break and craked a joke so I wouldn’t cry. We walked by the train tracks and down to where the Wildcat used to be. I looked over where they used to have concerts and stand #3 (mexican) where all the concerts were held remembering when I met and saw Debbie Gibbson perform my last year there. Then I had to get out of there. All of the memories started overwhelming me. So my baby brother and I headed walked down the rest of park by where the Flume was and exited the park. I’ve never really did get the closeure I was hoping for but it was great seeing her again and knowing although its physical existance was gone Rocky Point Amusement Park would forever live on in those who shared its short lived run.


Yeah, we miss the park. Some of us even wish we could rebuild the park. But all the City/State and SBA care about is the almighty dollar! Values and morals in america don’t exist anymore. This is what brought the park to close. It is ashame when you think about it.'

  content: 'I was just 21 years old and was the last set of employees to work at the park.  My first ride I ran was the House of Horrors. I really wasn’t  paying attention to how to run and what to shut off or on. I got alot  of people stuck inside, but they would come walking out because it was  nearly impossible to get lost in that structure. The last acts I remember  seeing as I worked was Peter Frampton (his comeback time) and Weird  Al Yankovich. I also worked on the flume. I used to fall asleep on the  second hill when I was supposed to be seperating the logs so they wouldn’t  bang into each other as they went down the last big hill. When I was  about 4 or 5 there was a FunHouse, the opposite of the house of Horrors.  I was always scared to go in the Fun House. As I got older they closed  the fun house and made the bottom into a food court. As I was running  the House of Horrors, there was a 8-track tape that we would play in  a loop all day and night. Well there was also another 8-track tape that  the boss said didn’’t go for the house of horrors. It was the  8-Track tape for the old FunHouse. I don’t remember too many people  who remember the Fun House, but when the final day came and we all parted  our way from the park. I took the ONLY RARE COPY of the 8-Track that  went to the rarely seen funhouse that was there at least in the 60’s  and 70’s (when I remember it). I still have that 8-track, and  made copys of it in the 8-track format and treasured the origanal, which  I still have and still works. I am now 34 going on 35 but that FunHouse  Tape I love and may not be worth much to people who don’t remember  it. Every one knew about the House of Horrors, but this tape is one  of my most treasured pieces that would have been lost or destroyed if  I never took it. I found it behind the 8-track player in the house of  horrors and my boss always said that this wasn’t the tape for  the house of horrors, but another tape from a ride that was once there.  I knew what I had, as soon as I got home I popped it in my old 8-track  player and remember exactly what I remember hearing back when I was  4 or 5. I was always scared of the fun house more than the house of  horrors. But I tell ya, even though I was 21 when the park closed, I  was always scared to walk through the house of horrors. That house of  horrors must have went through at least 4 changes that I can remember  since I was a child. Rocky Point was the biggest part of my childhood  growing up in the 70’s and being born in 71. Fireworks, Clamcakes,  Fries, Chowder, and DoughBoy. My favorate game was always the BB Gun  Range where you had to shoot out the star from the card. I never won,  but it was awesome. And they moved the skyrockets above that game shed.  Anyone remember the rumor about the kids who jumped off the skyliner  where it turned around at the rock cliff? That was a good old story  for a while!!'

  content: 'My first memory of RP was going to the park while visiting relatives in CT (we lived in ME). My cousin and I had the same frames for our glasses, and when we took them back from our mothers after riding the “log ride”, they had mixed them up!


Later on, as teenagers, my sister, cousin and I went to RP on our own during another visit to CT. This time, we bought some of those exquisite clamcakes to take back home. My cousin set the paper bag of cakes on top of her car while unlocking the door, and a seagull swooped down and grabbed the bag! We were stunned, but Kathy fought that darned bird — and won.


After I met my now husband, originally from Providence, we went to RP once and it rained so bad the rides were shut down. We got our picture taken in one of those booths. I still have the pics. We were soaked, but had a great time. 


By the time our first daughter was born (1997) and we were living in Providence (1998), RP had been closed and was in decline. For Halloween of 1998, the House of Horrors was open just for fun, so we went; mainly for the nostalgia.


Another memory I have of RP was riding the Rock N Roll with my cousin (the seagull fighter) and her dad. The seat belts didn’t work properly on the ride, and I almost fell out. I never went on that ride again.


Now I live in Western Washington. There’s an amusement park here called Wild Waves &amp; Enchanted Village. It used to be independently owned, but sold out to Six Flags a few years ago. The first time we went, I saw this huge red and white roller coaster that looked vaguely familiar. Later on, I found out it was the Corkscrew from RP! The next time we went to Wild Waves, the Corkscrew was painted this ugly green color, and it’s new name is The Wild Thing.

So when we got to  the park I did not want to ride the dreaded “House of Horrors”.  But part of me was still curious. My uncle and dad forced me to confront  my fear and quit being such a chicken. I was Ok for the first 10 seconds  of the ride but terror struck me as the car clicked up the ascent. I  closed my eyes and wanted to hide on the floor of the car. They heckled  me the whole time as the car jerk about through doors and what not. Didn’t see a thing until the car stopped. I might have peeked  once for a split second! I never rode it again.

The next summer I worked  in the Fudge Kitchen which was across from the carousel. I worked at  the Fudge Kitchen for 5 summers in a row. The first few years I worked  at Rocky Point the crowds were large and business was brisk. My last  few years there the crowds thinned and began to change from mostly families  with kids to teenagers. In an effort to bring in more business the management  sponsored late night raves and Greatful Dead cover bands. It was sad  to witness Rocky Point’s decline.

Then it was off to the dining hall for chowder  and clamcakes then finishing it all off with, if I remember right watermelon.  Next were the rides, my fondest memory had to be my sister and I along  with my grandmother in the Scrambler, we all laughed so hard as she  was trying to keep from “squishing” us as the ride went  from side to side. Now that I look back on it she had to be in her 60’s  when she went on these rides, dang I miss her so much she was the coolest!  Another time my sister and I were on the gondola ride above the minature  golfcourse and we both made the mistake of dropping things on the players  below and when we got back to the landing the attendant wanted to take  us both back to the office but as you can imagine my grandmother would  have no part of that! I went back there once I think about 1997 and  it was closed,very depressing to me to see Rocky Point in the state  i found it because I had not known it had been closed.

I  would ride the Enterprise and the Skydiver and be afraid of the YoYo  ever since one summer it toppled over and was out of commission for  a while. The house of horrors is still one of the scariest rides I can  remember.

About 17 or so years ago, my Aunt and Uncle  bought a cottage at Rocky Beach and we spent many summers sitting in  her yard enjoying the atmosphere that the Park brought us. After spending  our summers at my Aunt and Uncle’s House, my parents then bought  their own cottage at Rocky Beach about 4-5 years ago. This is where  they still spend their summers. We’ve celebrated all of our summer  birthdays and holidays at “the cottage” since there is no  where else we wanted to be. Most of our childhood, teenage, and adult  memories originated from our experiences and celebrations at the Rocky  Point Amusement Park and at the cottages at Rocky Beach. Now…  after so many people cried the day they closed, the land is sold to  high corporate businesses and they are taking it all away from us to  make millions of dollars.

One time Saint Raymonds school had an outing in the fall. It was raining and most of the rides were shut down for the season. One or 2 classmates figured out how to start the dodge’ems (I never knew they were called “Skooter”). We rode around for FREE for at least a half hour before Sister Cathlene came looking for us. She walked around for awhile before her conscience got the better of her and made us quit. 


I live on the West Coast now and you couldn’t find a Clam Cake with a magnifying glass. The only thing remotely close to those things is an amusement park in Santa Cruz, Ca. It has an old wooden Roller Coaster like Crescent Park.'

I was 3 when we first started to go. In my eyes I was Rocky Point’s favorite little girl that came to visit them. I only thought that way because when I was 4 years old they let me ride the Corkscrew. Well, that is because my mom signed an agreement that if I died on the ride or fell off it wasn’t their fault and she couldn’t sue them and that I always had to ride with an adult. I rode that coaster like there was no tomorrow. I also remember that when I’d ride the Cyclone with family members that they couldn’t stay on as long as I could. That still amuses me to this day. By the time I was either 6 or 7 Rocky Point was having financial problems. We went once when they switched owners and we didn’t stay there for more than 15mins. It was terrible.

I’m 32 now, and to this day, Rocky Point was the coolest job I have ever had! I still walk past people making cotton candy in festivals an such and say, “Hmm. Amateurs! Try getting cotton candy to stick to a cone in 100% humidity!” I vividly remember coming home completly sugar coated after working all day.


I have a few theories on why Rocky Point is no longer. One in particular is the popularity of the television. More and more people were staying home on summer nights. Another reason is security. Toward the end it got worse and worse, with the fights every night and gangs of youth that showed up. This pushed the families away.


Also, Rocky Point also had a huge employee theft problem. Their employees would rip them off, big time! Everything was CASH! I believe they paid the “game of chance” employees next to nothing because they KNEW they would pocket money for themselves.


And finally, the park was simply, and sadly out of date. How could RP compete with places like Six flags. It would’ve taken an enormous amount of money to give the park what it needed and nobody would put up that kind of money for a park located in a residential neighborhood, with no easy highway access. RP just wouldn’t work if it were reopened today.


RP used to bring people from around the world to work the summer. People as far away as Indonesia! (Two smoking hot girls from Scotland come to mind) I miss all of them, and the good times at RP.'

That was the last thing he wanted to do after a day in a sweaty jewelry shop, but he did it anyway. After an exhilerating ride on the Whip, my next stop was the Penny Arcade. The Gypsy grandmother would whir out a fortune card for me; and I would never miss putting my penny in the little machine where you looked into an ornate viewer and turned a little handle which rapidly flipped the many photo cards inside, making an animation happen before your eyes! I’d buy a little cellophane Kewpie doll on a stick, with feathers and sparkles, or a colorful paper parasol. Topping the night off with those fantastic clam cakes, I would go to bed a happy child.

You knew summer was here when you saw or heard their advertisement.


My entire family would stand in line to get some “cakes and chowder”. I didn’t even like clams in those days but the cakes were too good to resist. I particularly liked throwing the clam cakes from the dock as high into the air as possible and watch the sea gulls gobble them in mid air.


I have many fond memories with family and grandparents and think it’s a shame that future generations won’t get to experience it. 


I live on the west coast now and can only dream of taking my three children there. They would’ve loved it. I keep trying to recreate their clam cakes and chowder in my California kitchen (theres no chowder and cakes here you know) but it certainly doesn’t taste the same.'

  content: 'The park was wiped out in the 38 hurricane and remained dormant for 10 years. It came under the control of Vincent Ferla, among others, and Vincent screwed his partners out of their share. Vincent had two brothers, Corado and John. My Dad owned a bar at 45 Atwells Ave. which he had to sell to his younger brother Pete in 1948 upon the death of their mother. My Dad borrowed $5000 from his sister Lena and brought a ride to the 1948 Rocky Point called the Spitfire (see photo). My Dad’s on the right. The Penny arcade is in the background. It was owned by Louie Mazza from Bridgeport, CT. Louie had a brother Mario who stood about 6’4&quot; — huge gentle giant. These are the original Mario brothers.
  

Anyway, my dad went to the Pokerino one day to change a $20 bill and Jimmy Vogel (Diamond Jim) went with a bushel of bills to change them. At that moment, Dad knew he was in the wrong business with the Spitfire ride. 


He sold the Spitfire and constructed the concrete Skee Ball building at the base of the hill across from the Penney Arcade. Dad went to the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and bought 20 alleys ($2000 per alley) with no credit. The owner told my Dad had an honest face and he could pay him when he could. Skee Ball was 5 cents at the time. He waited for Crescent and Lincoln Parks to go to 10 cents for 1 season, and then raised his price. In doing this, he took their customers. The box that collected dimes was beneath the lever you pulled to release a vertical stop that allowed the 9 balls to come down. This box could hold $500 in dimes. On a good Sunday, the Skee Ball could gross $2000. That’s 20,000 games or 1000 games per machine. That’s about 80 games per hour for 12 hours.


We’d be prepping the stands prior to Memorial Day opening and we’d hear shotgun blasts. A while later, we’d see the 3 Ferla brothers walking down the midway from the merry go round with their shotguns and dinner; pigeons. Those guys would eat almost anything. Their mother lived in the house on the hill above the SkeeBall. John Ferla and his wife Pina lived with her there. John handled all of the park’s maintenance issues. Vincent and his wife Carolyn lived over the Cliff House, a lounge on the cliff overlooking the bay. It also incorporated the park office. Conrad Ferla ran the Shore Dinner Hall.


When minimum wage was $1.25/hr my brother in law and I worked the stand one 3rd of July and lost 72 stuffed animals to winners (our most expensive prize was $36/doz wholesale). We grossed a hair over $1000. That was a great day. But the park business was sometimes the most boring place in the world. imagine, 3pm, Wed, July, 100 deg, no one around in the park, the park music permeating everthing, no one but an 8 year-old kid with one dime. You’ve made 40 cents the previous 2 hours since opening. The kid plays his name, Joe, wins, and makes you climb to the top of the stand where the temp is 125 deg to get a 6 foot stuffed goofy looking snake.


My Dad also owned the Skooter (aka Dogde-em, bumper cars) ride. That was a 2 minute ride for 20 cents. It was the only ride in the park not owned by Vincent Ferla, the park owner. It also was the only ride where you exited the ride and then paid. It was also portable. The walls were collapsible. Almost no one knows that. When Ferla refused to give Dad a 5 year lease on his other 15 concession (Skee Ball, Rocky (bingo for prizes) game, fish pond, hoopla, 3 stuffed animal stands (A1 A2 and A3), Blanket stand, doll stand, lamp stand, knock down the cats, cig/candy, basketball — he brought in a tractor trailer and began ride disassembly 1 week before the official opening. This would have left a wonderful “hole” in the park. Dad got his lease.


I remember once the concessionaires elected NOT to hire the Beatles for a 3-day engagement for $20K because they felt it was too much money.'

We were just a small crew that wanted to make our own skate park, to our suprise that we built a great indor skate park that it attracted some visiting pro skateboarders from the Gravity Games. Those pics give no justice to what our final project turned out to be. I wish I had some pics. We had a lot of fun and trouble in that place until some ungrateful punk kids lite our above lounge room on fire and sootted the place up. We abandoned it once again and no one returned except the homeless that live there. In 2003 were returned when we picked up Paint Ball. We then built on the top floor a 4 room paint ball war house that had multiple secret entrances and hide outs, and we wanted to buy it out and make it a legit paintball business. We did our research and Providence did not want to sell. So what ever they do with it I am just glad that we made history with our teenage hood hang out spot. PSC '

In Europe, they preserve and protect their rich history and pass on their traditions from one generation to the next, but in Rhode Island we have neglected and abandoned what we always claimed to have favored such as the Brewery, the Outlet, Rocky Point, the Shore Dinner Hall, the Warwick Musical Theatre, etc., etc. Of course, the politicians and land developers call this “progress”. All of these places, however, could have been saved if only the younger generation were as proud, aggressive, business savvy and innovative as their ancestors once were. Yes, we need to get our act together and the politicians need to stop catering to the rich and powerful! Replacing our history and traditions with things like Lowes, Condominiums, and fancy strip malls is not a very good thing for the Ocean State.

  content: 'I moved to the Arlington section of Cranston in the spring of 1990 and one of the first things I noticed was the old brewery. When I got to know the kids in the nieghborhood, we’d explore the grounds and while walking the tracks that ran along side the brewery and under Cranston St. you could see a visual time line. Many of the buildings that made up the once thriving factory each had it’s erected date, signifying the difference in time periods. It was really cool to see and ultimetly taken for granted. That summer, we found a way into the old brewery, which was no easy task. We had to litterally climb into an open window that was perched about eight or nine feet from the ground, and once you were up there, you had to wedge your body through the brick interior and the conveyor belt that ran down into a small dark tunnel on your right. On your left you could see a larger opening that lead to a much larger room. It was very creepy (the chipped paint, the smell of mildew etc.) Crates with empty beer bottles still sat on the conveyor belts, Playboy centerfolds lined the locker room walls, all dating back to the mid 60’s to late 70’s. It was pretty cool stuff and yes, taken for granted. You could clearly see when the day came and shut down for good, everybody stopped what they were doing and just left. Very creepy but cool none the less. Ounce you made it up and through and over (you had to crawl down the belt to the larger room on your left) you had countless hours of fun and dangerous exploring to accomplish. Not all of the brewery could be explored however. The old catwalk bridge was securly locked so I never got to see the whole brewery. On the other side of the property ( facing Garfield) me and my friend Josh had a small hangout spot under one of the loading docks. He noticed a vent cover under the loading dock and we decided to take a screw driver to it and after several minutes of hard labor, we got the metal cover off. What we found was the ULTIMATE hangout destination. When your a 13 year old kid, this was better than Rocky Point!!!!!!! We’d go to the NHD ( now abandon!!) on Cranston St. and buy spray paint to decorate the walls inside. Im not to sure the purpose of this room was, it looked like some sort of bomb shelter. It had no windows and was very dark ( even in broad daylight) so a flashlight was always needed. And on the far end (where Gibbs School is located) was this big blue tower that overlooked the whole damn brewery. The view, (and I don’t mean to be cheesey) was breath taking. I really miss that place and looking at the old photo’s really brought me back. It was an amazing building providing so much history and adventure. It was all taken for granted. The fire a few years later only caused security to be beefed up, ending any future fun. I consider myself lucky, but pissed!! I thought that place would be there forever (like Rocky Point) at my disposal.'

They played a great game against Marvin Barnes’ freshman team from PC. As those players got older, I remember sellouts of 1,200+ and people sitting on the upstairs track and on the floor at the ends in front of the bleachers. One night a fan threw a workboot on the floor to protest a bad call. At that time, the court was oriented north-south and so it was really intimate. That was just as the Civic Center was being built. So Brown would play a couple games a year at the Civic Center but most games at Marvel. I was waterboy for two seasons and really loved it, but the team could never win on the road against Penn and Princeton so never even made NIT. Best player I ever saw there: Brian Taylor of Princeton, who went on to play with the Nets. Saw the Penn coach who coached the Pistons to the NBA titles coach there too. Spacing on his name, but my memory of him is that he was in a fancy suit, puffing on a cigarette underneath the stands.'

I’ll be happy to send them to you for posting if you give me an e-mail address. 

The building was eerie, especially since I had vague memories of going shopping there when I was younger. I believe it was the first downtown department store with central air conditioning, a big attractant for summer shopping. There were massive compressors and huge (asbestos insulated) ducts all over the top floor that chilled air and dropped it to the floors below. 

The next floor down had offices and staff areas that looked very 1950s-60s. The neatest place was the employee check-in area. There were wall hooks where floor workers hung their outdoor coats, a counter with numbered cubicles where they checked their pocketbooks or personal effects, and a changing room where they put on their W.T. Grants uniforms for the work day. It all still had a vague “ready for work tomorrow” look to it.'

Later it got a new facade and became the oft-avoided Traveller’s Aid place, and Strawberry’s Records, and, a smaller record shop called Rainbow Records. Outside the Dunkin Donuts an innocuous stone/concrete planter was known later on the street, according to the news, as the infamous “the island”. It was a hangout for genuinely creepy types sometimes, and profiled as the “starting point” for those now-jailed hoodlums who infamously robbed/carjacked/shot a young couple using an ATM.

The garage is plainly meant to accomodate these interests. Easing the city’s parking restrictions would help some of these new residents find parking for their cars.

The ProJo article calls this “an effort to reinvent what used to be the city’s downtown shopping district.” It concerns me that so much of downtown Providence is in the hands of just a few players with the same plan in mind.

Out goes the Dunkin Donuts, a bar, a popular live performance venue, a social services agency, and two small “specialty’ stores, to be replaced by – what? Oh, “conveniences such as a florist or dry cleaner and a specialty store with a Providence flavor ”. Great.

Nobody who ever passed Travelers Aid on a warm day, when the smell of stale piss came off the street and sidewalks, will truthfully regret that it’s moved elsewhere; but “ridding” the city of troublesome types and the places they frequent reflects a suburban, gated-community approach to urban planning.'

And this is just for that square mile area! I’d say we were over adaquetly supplied in that area? Time to divert more attention into renovating old station houses, building new ones, making new bus routes, encouraging more walking, otherwise small seemingly insignifigant buildings such as this will be used to henpeck the city little by little into a giant car yard for Boston, where pedestrians are stopped every 15 feet to wait for a lot patrons to exit.

My family (going back 3 generations) lived there, too, until the last of us moved out in the mid 1980s. I have heard many stories from relatives that when they were growing up – they used to play in the complex (disaster waiting to happen). After seeing a mill fire up the other end of Valley Street as a kid, I constantly used to worry that this mill would catch fire, and we would lose our house. Judging by the pictures and the conditions of the mill (and the many mill fires I have seen since), I dont think my fears were off base… While I am all for preservation of these types of buildings (similar to the work done at both ends of Valley Street) I think there was only so much at that time that could be done, and really, in the end, this was a win-win for the neighborhood. As the visual aspects of the neighborhood look so much better. However, for personal reasons, I am glad they chose to save the Uncas Building (My grandmother, and other relatives worked there for many years). When I drive by, I can still see them (from when I was a kid) waving their hankees/white towels in the window at me, towards our house, as our living room windows faced where they all sat. It was a big thrill as a kid. After my grandmother passed away a few years ago, I drove down Newark street – when I got to the corner of Valley street, and I looked up at the top floor of Uncas – I saw that same sight (although I realized a few minutes later, it was just workmen) and for just those few seconds, I saw Grandma.'

The composite photo (of the Mercantile Block with Hotel on top), looks a little more interesting though and would at least provide a space for the Cuban Revolution and New Japan to stay at. I think that providing accomadations for established businesses is particularly important as most were there when times weren’t good. They provided the good food, entertainment, and services that helped back up the city’s “Providence Renaissance” campaign in the 90s when people were looking for more evidence of it beyond the hype of the new mall and relocated rivers, as good as they have been. What would be the motivator of an established business to stay or a new business to stay long term if there was always an easy threat of displacement? Why not just take up residence in Cranston, Warwick, Johnston, where that threat would not be easily realized?'

Don’t let some “grain elevators” cloud your imagination. One day you will approach the city on well thought out roads and realize what an “I” sore they were.'

  content: 'We lived in my wife’s family 3-decker in Olneyville during the early 1980’s, and I poked around many of the local industrial sites. My strong recollection of the Atlantic / Blue Coal towers – which loomed with wonderful eerie monumentality over that corner – was that they were leaning at a frightening angle, presumably from settling. The photos here seem to bear this out.'

  content: 'I have an old wood thermometer that advertises “blue coal” made by Dorfmann Bros and I’m trying to identify the source of the “blue coal”. The advertisin source is D. F_ADD (can’t make out what follows the “f”) and the address is 623 Scio St. I am assuming this is in Rochester NY. The slogan says: “Americas Finest Anthracite”. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks'

  content: 'I was researching Narragansett Brewery and came upon this wonderful website! I cannot believe that they tore down the Atlantic Coal Company “Blue Coal” storage silos. I didn’t know they had done this, and if I had not seen this website I would probably not have noticed. How strange it is too see a photo and all the memories come pouring back. It’s a pity it took knocking them down for me to really notice how impressive they really were.'

What next, <a href="/arch/?id=decay&amp;pr=seekonkbridge">the raised railroad bridge</a>?? Why not, they destroyed phillipsdale landing.'

  content: '“blue coal” was not a Reading Railroad trademark. It was the trade mark of the DL&amp;W Coal Sales Company, a subsidiary of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad company. Mining of the coal was spun off to the Glen Alden Coal Company after the anti trust proceedings forced the railroads to rid themselves of the mining operations, but DL&amp;W Coal Sales continued on for a while. The Reading trademark was “Famous Reading Anthracite”, a name that survived the railroad that created it.'

  content: 'Thanks so much for making this information available! We used to see this building from the car all the time, coming around the curve that links Rt. 6 to Rt. 10. It always looked so mysterious and strange rising up out of the landscape next to the freeway. I’ve never seen anything like it, actually, and I’m very sorry it’s been torn down. When I was little, mother once told me the coal “burned blue,” hence the name – I’m not sure that’s accurate but I bet lots of folks from Olneyville or Silver Lake would say the same thing.'

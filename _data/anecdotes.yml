  content: 'In 1957 I had a summer job working in the woolen tubular jersey drying room of the factory. It was very uncomfortable working in a hot, humid room with floating lint and smelling of lanolin while sitting on a stool in front of a wire drying rack that was mounted over a hole in the floor, where long pieces of wet tubular wool jersey were pulled from tubs where they were washed on the floor below. My job was to guide the material over a wire drying rack while it was blasted with hot air ‚Äî then pulled between a set of rollers and rolled into bolts. There were about ten of these racks, arranged in two rows, with a worker sitting at each one. All the other guys were blue-collar workers, who swore like sailors, with every other word they uttered being the F-word. They were very nice guys, however, and we all got along just fine. The machinery that operated the assembly was ancient, having been built in the 1880s, and consisted of an elaborate set of pulleys and belts operated by a central motor. There was no shutoff switch to stop the machine in case the material got jammed, and the only way to stop it was to reach up and pull the belt off one of the pulleys. Once this happened, and when I tried to do so, I was not fast enough, and my fingers got caught between the sharp-edged pulley and the belt. My fingers got cut, but it could have been more severe had I not spent years playing the piano, which built up my finger muscles and prevented the finger bones to be broken. I‚Äôm 88 now, and I‚Äôm amazed to find that my old workplace has been converted into these beautiful apartments.'

We used to bowl at Seekonk Lanes but when they were bought out and demolished it to build a Pet Boys we had nowhere to go and it was only a month or so away from our new season. Our league had been around for many years at Seekonk and it looked like that was gonna be the end. I took league over and promised I‚Äôd try and find a spot for us to continue. All Friday nights (which was our night) were booked. The last place I tried was Chips Down Under. I met owner Chip Merola an old timer who chain smoked Chesterfields. He said he had 6 lanes left (19-24) if I wanted them I could have them. It was an old time worn alley that had cement at the lane approach that turned to wood. Clanky old ball returns but they mostly seemed to work. Hey he saved our league at that time. We had more bowlers than those 6 lanes could handle but we got creative. We had some bye weeks and survived. We got 2 more lanes available to us the next year and we stayed with Chip for several more years. We moved on to Legion Bowl and then to Dudeks in Warren. The league is still going strong today though I‚Äôve since stepped aside. I know Chip and the lanes are sadly long gone. Though I have so many great memories. Love your sight. PS: I could of been Helen Keller but if you took me down the stairs to the lanes I can still smell the odor of French fries and stale Chesterfields ‚ù§Ô∏è'

I learned that Jonathan Nelson ‚Äò77 (an entrepreneur and Rhode Island‚Äôs only billionaire at the time) had refused to give money for the fitness center as designed by SHoP Architects, of NYC, because of its modernist style, and recommended the traditional design firm RAMSA (after founder Robert A.M. Stern), which supplied an excellent traditional design. Nelson won a award for stewardship for his stalwart action in favor of beauty from the New England chapter of the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art. A few years later he financed the Brown Entrepreneurship Center, on Thayer Street, near the campus. Its modernist style shows how difficult it is to kill off bad design concepts.'

    Came across your site and interesting to see that Brown University finally went through with there plans from when my parents leased a business at this site in July 2010. There business was called Wings and Things in what was where Piezoni‚Äôs location before the demolition. We opened the business in Riverside, RI in January 2004 and moved to 250 Brook Street years later. We were lucky to have great neighbors like Dave Faria, Mini-Mart owner, next to us and he and my father got along well. Bagel Gourmet was also a good neighbor. We eventually closed the business in June 2014 as my parents decided to retire and no one wanted to purchase the business because of Brown‚Äôs clause in the lease that they could demolish the buildings and have everyone reopen in about 6 months time, at least from what I am able to recall.
    
    There were a lot of interesting times at that location. We were fortunate to have a lot of support from locals, Brown employees, and students, and Brown was a good owner who listened to our concerns if we brought them up. Even more fortunate to have a parking lot. I recall the only main issue we and other businesses had was when food trucks began to descend on our street and nearby. There was quite a lot of uproar at the time due to food trucks not having the same things as other businesses such as permits and adhering to taxes. Once they started to park near Thayer Street, businesses in the area began speaking up more and seeking help from both the government and Brown. All worked out eventually.
    
    While a shame this building has now been demolished and causing more friction within the neighborhood due to dorms being added, it does not surprise me. Even back in 2010 it was expected that Brown would make way for dorms in that location. I even recall around 2011 an upheaval in Providence on how universities were not paying their fair share of taxes, Brown especially due to a contract or something signed in the 1800s when it was still a very small campus. Even now, I still predict that Brown and other universities will eventually push out locals as the taxes and other problems arise. Still, there were some good memories in the area that I will cherish.

    I was born in 1995, so I never got to experience this park for myself. In fact right around the time I was born, a lot of the fun things to do and great stores in RI started to wind down or disappear completely. Weird how that happens.

    When I was a teenager we found the abandoned cottages. Never broke into the park or anything like that, even though I LOVE abandoned places. I‚Äôve seen many YouTube videos online of it tho!! Did people live in those cottages year round? Or only in the summer!

    I do have the Rocky Point Documentary DVD. I‚Äôve watched it so many times. I lost the original DVD, and my grandma got me another copy for Christmas. Love her! That same DVD I brought to my RI studies class in high school, because our teacher was telling us about Rocky Point. I brought up the fact I have a copy of the DVD, and could bring it to class next time. Our teacher was like ‚Äúhell yeah! Bring it!‚Äù We watched the whole thing during class a couple weeks later. It was really really cool to see my classmates watching a DVD of mine, of a past amusement park. Idk why but it hits different when it‚Äôs your copy and not a copy from a library haha.

    Now the Clam Shack in Warwick is gone. The Chowder House in Warwick is long gone too. It seems any time a business wants to revive the Rocky Point name in RI, it closes down after a few years. I have no idea what is up with that but it‚Äôs strange how these places never last, especially considering how much RI natives still adore this park!

    I haven‚Äôt checked out the state park yet. I kinda find it more interesting when it was abandoned. Frozen in time almost. I wish they hadn‚Äôt of torn the Rocky Point sign down at the entrance. I do believe it could have been restored with a bit of elbow grease! Everyone talks of the chowdah and clam cakes, but how was the other food? Like the Mexican stand and the pizza stand too?

    There have been Facebook pages to bring the state park back to an amusement park, but I don‚Äôt think that will ever happen. It would be cool to see a modern day Rocky Point with modern technology like WiFi and smart devices, and maybe even an app lolz. We can only dream‚Ä¶

We called the area across from the PX, where you could go down to the water ‚ÄúThe Rocks.‚Äù
    
    The fire station ‚Äî yes ‚Äî skating in the winter. The firemen helped us with our skates. Such great sledding across from Jefferson. The beautiful view at the point, where you could see Rose Island. America‚Äôs Cup in 1958. I lived there when the tankers collided in the fog, on an early morning in 1958; it was tragic. The water was on fire from all the oil.
    
    I LOVED that cemetery that overlooked the Bay. When I lived there, there was a brass bed frame on one of the graves. We trick-or-treated at the beautiful home where I believe an Admiral lived, and Eisenhower visited. I remember the guards posted across from Jefferson, on that hill, when Ike visited. My dad sent us up there with coffee and donuts (home-made) for the guards.
    
    I have so many memories of my two years there, and have been back several times, now living on the west coast. The first time I was back was 18 years after I left, the steps to the houses were all that was left on Jefferson, and that long drive down to the rows of garages. The next time I went, the whole area was a giant grassy field, and I just felt lost.  Just didn‚Äôt seem right. I was last back about six years ago. The PX was still there, and the firehouse ‚Äî I believe that was deserted. There were a lot of places that were ‚Äúoff limits,‚Äù but I found my way around. I remember some kind of structure that filled up with water, but it sure seemed a lot bigger when I was a child! I could go on and on‚Ä¶ but weren‚Äôt we all lucky? So wonderful to connect with people who share those awesome memories!

    Since this is st.dunstan‚Äôs day, i did a search on the school and luckily found this page. I attended the old st. dunstan‚Äôs at 84 & 88 benefit streeet from 1942 to 1944. my father used to go to the old r.i. reds hockey games with roy howard, and they woud sit in roy‚Äôs car when he dropped dad off and chat, and roy convinced him that his school was best for me. my class had only ten people in it, including john paulsen, who became my best friend. i also remember dick alberg, malcom powell, everett piccione, ray tainsh, bob abell, (who has written on this page earlier) and many others, whose names have been lost to me in the mists of time.

    i do remember mrs.coulberg, who made lunch, and playing baseball in the concrete schoolyard, and going to daily chapel in the catholic church building below, where roy, wearing cassock and surplice, delivered a daily ex tempore sermon.

    i went to school in bob day‚Äôs bus, and he taught algebra as well. i was part of the grace church choir under william c. heller, who taught a daily class in ‚Äúvoice production,‚Äù and of the glee club later, much to my mother‚Äôs delight. she said we sounded like the vienna boys choir, which i doubt, though we were pretty good. roy was a charismatic man who coached our baseball and football teams to one losing record after another. he installed a communications system throughout the school through which he could talk to all of us or some us at the flick of a switch. he could also listen to a classroom when the teacher was out of the room (or in it, i suppose}. i was very impressed by it.

    in many ways, st. dunstan‚Äôs changed my life, and i‚Äôve always remembered bill heller as the first really good teacher i had.

    i left providence for new york 60 years ago and subsequently moved to california, where i‚Äôve lived ever since. i‚Äôve been back to providence only a couple of times ‚Äî it‚Äôs changed as much as i have.

    I have an envelope addressed to a Dr Fenner H. Peckham, M.D. postmarked 1899, 176 Benefit Street. I understand this to be his residence? Have the Street numbers changed? In 1877 a wire was run from his office on corner of Benefit and Halsey to his home where he received the first known phone emergency call!

    (**A.I.R.** Actually, yes, but its complicated. For example, what is now 134 Benefit St was number 72 in 1835, 104 in 1847, and then 136 in 1888. There were wooden buildings at around 176 Benefit Street before 1906, when the Arsenal was moved half a block to the north at what is now 176. Those structures were lost when the Arsenal was moved.)

In 1955, my father (Fred Singleton) purchased our first home at 24 Wheaton St (believe street name now changed to Pratt), a house that still stands just below the Prospect Terrace. I attended Benefit St. elementary school in the early 50s, Doyle Ave middle, Nathan Bishop junior high, and graduated Hope High in mid 60s. I have super fond memories of coming of age in Providence in the sixties and, as a young African-American boy at that time, had instilled in me by my mother a keen appreciation of the historic nature of the neighborhood in which I lived. In my early teens, a great deal of my time was spent at the Benefit Street Recreational Center, with its large gymnasium located just behind the main facility which catered to all the kids after school and on weekends. That landmark, which served as a haven for youngsters back then, has long since been torn down and any historical reference to it, unfortunately, appears now to be nonexistent. Such memories as the time young Jack Kennedy was campaigning for President (1960) and my mom took me downtown to look and listen, and the throngs of people all pushing and shoving to get as close as possible to the candidate, shall never be forgotten. Although I left the city many years ago, Providence remains to me a wonderful place to have lived and grown up; a city which evokes warm feelings as well as affectionate memories and a city which I shall always call my home. And, yes, I continue to visit from time-to-time.'

Around 1955 the School moved from 84 & 88 Benefit St to 140 (I think) Hope St, since demolished for the construction of Brown‚Äôs Electrical Engineering building. Looking at the Benefit St buildings on Maps, I see that the play yard is now a lovely flower garden. Looking up the back side of 88, I see the bay windows where I was in K & 1st on the top floor and the admin offices were on the first floor. The library 2nd and 3rd occupied the rest of the top floor of 88 while 4th & 5th were in 84 first and 7th 8th and 9th were on the second of 84. Looking across the garden to 84, I see one window in the basement where we had a cafeteria to eat in. There was an apartment for MR & Mrs Coleson, the custodian and his wife (the cook) in the back first floor of 84. During our tenure on Benefit St, the whole of the south end of Benefit and S. Main St below (except RISD), were what was known as slums. All the buildings were run-down with gaping holes in the foundations, siding falling off and many broken windows. We would walk down to S Main to catch the UER (United Electric Railway) bus out to Branch Ave. The UER had converted from rail to rubber tires several years prior to us using the lines but at first they were still using the overhead electric lines for power with two long booms at the back of the bus reaching up to the wires. Many of streets in Providence then were what most would call cobble stone but my father correctly called Belgian Block. You can still see them on Bowen St above Benefit.'

The back yard was all concrete where we played ball during recess, with a high fence separating it from the Cathedral graveyard downhill on the west. On occasion a ball would go over the fence, and there was a hatch and ladder we could pop through and down to search for our ball among the ancient stones. The building on the corner was associated with Edgar Allen Poe and one of his young ladies.

    I don‚Äôt remember the Lincoln Mall from when it was a bustling mall. I wasn‚Äôt born yet, by the time I was a kid. Lincoln Mall became the place to avoid, in favor of the Emerald Square Mall. Ironic how that played out now‚Ä¶

    I don‚Äôt remember all these stores of yesteryear like Caldor and The Dream Machine. But I do remember the organ store briefly. I loved the Papa Ginos in the mall and the claw machine they had! That Papa Gino‚Äôs was probably was the oldest thing inside the mall to date.

    I remember the mall as it was in the early 2000‚Äôs. When it had Claire‚Äôs, K-B Toys, Gamer Haven (the Yu Gi Oh craze.) , Silver Dragon and their incense, T Shirt City, and this CREEPY and I mean CREEPY kiddie carnival thing that was where Famous Footwear was. It was called Kiddie Playland or something. I always got the eeriest vibes walking by it. Like some demented clown weirdo set it up.

    K mart before Target. Pay/Half where you got the freshest millennial hip hop clothing ever. The Dunkin‚Äô Donuts was inside the mall and the ‚Äúmanagers special‚Äù was a chocolate frosted rainbow sprinkle donut. I even swiped a coin from the fountain one time and my parents were sooo pissed LOL!

    I loved this mall for what it was at the time, because it was quiet and I have never been a big fan of crowded bustling places. Now it‚Äôs pretty much an outdoor commons type of place.

    Also cannot forget the jobs I‚Äôve had at Lincoln Mall ‚Äî
    Party City - a few weeks.
    Stop & Shop - 3 weeks lol. They fired me because I didn‚Äôt get carts fast enough.

    Dollar Tree - AKA the retirement home. I always called it that because our customer base was mostly on the elderly side ahah.!

    As someone who actually lived in this building, I‚Äôm not actually sad it‚Äôs going. This picture looks kinda nice and spooky, but the building itself is falling apart. It was built before electricity and the retrofits to make it work were awful and fall apart. It was clearly further subdivided in a bad way in the last decades. The only circuit breaker was in the basement floor of that tea shop, so if your combined washer/dryer that never worked flipped a breaker on the third floor it would only be available if you called maintenance to open it up outside of regular office hours. The stairs inside were in a large central open area that wasted space and the stairs were curving down and out and felt like they‚Äôd be falling down soon. The internet and cable wires got corroded on the outside. The air conditioning was basically nonexistent. The spaces inside were clearly badly cut up and outside of some slightly modern flooring and bathroom amenities it was absolutely terrible. And it charged >$2700/month for it.
    
    This building was a few years away from being condemned, and whatever ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù it had was only something important for people walking or driving by, but a good mixed use dense housing plan makes way more sense.
    
    Not everything that happens to be old is worth preserving.

    In the 1990s, I fell in love with Pontiac Mill. It was an ideal environment for living/working studios, though not zoned for the changing world. A number of us had antique spaces and there were a few galleries and working studios. My dog Rose and I had half of the 2nd floor of one building, nearly 1/2 acre of floor space, previously occupied by an insurance company with bezillions of desks and typists. 
  
    I painted the floor and kept checking my calculator to be sure I had the decimal point in the correct place. Could it really take 40 gallons just to paint a floor???
    
    As Pontiac Antiques & Arts Emporium, I spent each day greeting the meagre foot traffic until the Boston Globe discovered us. Over the following year, hundreds of shoppers found their way to the 2nd floor, folded 4 page article from the Globe clutched in hand. I lived on the premises, carving out 1200 square feet just for me, waking to find snow on the window ledges, sending the aroma of hot soup throughout the building by the elevator shaft, visiting artisans in the building on snowy days, ducking through the brick archways to visit, watching the heron and egrets in the river. For a while, I rented a basement area for storage, under which one could hear water flowing and see water through chinks in the huge timbers of the floor ‚Äì had to leave there, as it caused a horrid lingering cough and mildew was growing on my furniture. 
    
    For some time, I rented the little structure that looks like a mini train station out front. We held open mics to which no one came. It took 30 gallons of paint to do the green and yellow exterior, but it was a joy to behold. Florence was the property manager and I surely gave her gray hair. One summer, with no customers and way too much time on our hands, one of the fellows on the property (an event marketer) peddled fruits and vegetables in front of the mill. That was the year we really exchanged words with all of the other tenants and actually met neighborhood folks. 
    
    There was a really imposing chain link fence around the property that sent an unwelcoming message to shoppers who really weren‚Äôt sure they were in the right place and I could never get the owners to approve removal. It was nearly impossible to get signage approval from a city that is mired in their own self importance. I never did get a certificate of occupancy for an antique shop. The codes indicated that there was no need for a new CO, but the building inspection dept was going to prevent me from opening an antiques shop there until I asked who it was that one had to sleep with to get approval in Warwick. Oddly enough, we never heard from them again. The rent was cheap, the sense of community was warm, and I carry memories of Pontiac Mill with me always. Warwick itself is no better or worse than any other little burg that cannot see the forest for the trees.

    I‚Äôm the eldest grandson of Skip & Rose LaVoie. I worked both in the restaurant and alongside my ‚ÄúGrampa Skip,‚Äù spending at least 2 summers behind a paintbrush or shovel. I think I started bussing tables, then washing dishes around age 12-13 in the late 70s and finally moved to Maine in March of 1988.

    If you look at the pictures of the trolley cars, you‚Äôll see one shot of a set of pocket doors. This is where the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù sat when it was a working trolley, but was repurposed as our liquor storage for as long as I can remember. That car was housed a lot of shelves for food and paper products as well as the pot washing station (and aforementioned liquor cabinet). The frontmost car was indeed a diner. I still remember sitting at one of the stools. Grampa Skip would give me these quarters with red paint on them to pop into the juke box. (There was one at every counter stool and every table in the dining room, and they connected to a central master Juke Box). I learned later that the red painted ones would go back to him when the man came to empty them. My favorite things to order when I sat there was the Purple Cat Special Cheeseburger (little bigger patty, swiss cheese, fresh grilled mushrooms) and occasionally a lobster roll. I actually still remember Rene, the older man who sat and played organ in the dining room. I‚Äôm so sorry that‚Äôs not a common site anymore. I used to come in after school, during the break between lunch and dinner and play it a bit.

    During High school and 2nd year of college, I worked as cook. 1981-1988 with a couple of breaks to spend time in Maine. Summers I would paint and do other jobs with my grandfather. I painted the entire outside of the restaurant one summer as well as most of the apartment building across the street. Such a long long history. So long that my two cousins Tara and Kelsea (Keith‚Äôs daughters) were only babies when I left. They went on to work there into (I think) their adulthood. 1929-2005. Wow.
    
    By the way, the Purple Cat Vinyard and Winery is an entirely separate business, located behind the original restaurant, unrelated to the Purple Cat Restaurant (Diner)

    I really really wish this place was still around. Never got the chance to visit since by the time it closed down, I was still in grade school.
    
    There aren‚Äôt really any mom &amp; pop novelty shops around these days. Seems like once the owners retire, it‚Äôs the curtain call for the store. The closest thing we have to a novelty store these days at Halloween season is Spirit Halloween, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same vibe that I imagine this place would.
    
    When I saw the news report of the fire inside the building I was at a loss for words. I would always go by in the car, seeing all the things they advertised in front of the long abandoned building, Hawaiian ice, cotton candy, Halloween costumes, carnival games, party accessories, fog machines, etc. wondering what they were like back in the day.
    
    If you ever stumble upon a place like Morris Novelty ever again: Treasure it, and take some pictures and video! Because these stores are a lost art these days. Miss them so much!

    Hi, all, When I was a child we lived next to Rocky Point Park. Only locals might remember but there was a big white historic home on a small hill overlooking the sandy beach and our address was The Farm House, Rocky Beach Rd. The view of the bay from our house was amazing. It was a great place to grow up!

    The Rocky Beach summer cottages were part of that land. Sadly that big house burned down not long after the land was sold and I believe it was the city workers association of Warwick bought the house as a sort of recreational center. That was a sad lost for them as it was a beautiful property. It also broke my heart hearing of the fire and knowing the place were I lived as a child was gone forever.

    I remember so well the Park and the Ferlas. Vincent Ferla Sr. who owned the  amusement park became a family friend of my parents. He knew I loved animals and horses and allowed me to keep my first horse on the grounds of the park. It was a horse he bought and he gifted the horse to me in the mid 1960‚Äôs. I remember the animal acts that used to come to the park - no one else seems to have shared memories of that. Mr Ferla also installed a small animal zoo within the park for a few years.

    Because I lived adjacent to the park, naturally I spent fun times there and also have wonderful memories of the all the rides, the shore dinner hall, the huge salt water swimming pool, the famous music acts who played at the park! I even remember winters ice skating on the small pond which was behind the swimming pool.

    Just as with many of you, my first summer job as a kid was there (at the Taffy Stand on the midway) .

    What I loved most was the natural beauty of all the land there. I swam in the bay nearly everyday and as a tomboy roamed the woods, climbed the high rocks in the woods there, explored the tidal pools along the shore and rode my horse in the fields adjacent the park as a teenager.

    I‚Äôm so grateful the land was saved and has been returned to its natural beauty as a state park! Saving the land from ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù was a big win. It now looks the way it must have looked many, many hundreds of years ago!

    Of course I miss the amusement park and all the fun times it brought to both young and old through the years. The memories are so vividly written about by so many here on this site that it‚Äôs clear it was a very special place.

    Rocky Point Amusement Park had an amazing history and an impact on so many! Thanks to all who have written about it and thank you for allowing me to share my own memories.

    In the mid 00s I went on a few dates with a guy finishing med school at Brown. He was renting a unit in one of the beautiful Providence mansions from the 1800s that had been converted to apartments. He told me he had found a hidden door (that led to another door) opening into an underground tunnel system. Not believing him, I told him to show me. He brought me down to an expansive basement (which looked straight out of a horror movie with a dirt floor, covered in cobwebs and debris) and sure enough, there was a panel that just looked like it went to a crawl space. But upon moving the board, it opened up to another structure that had an arched entryway that was blocked off with piles and piles of rocks. He told me he had been moving the rocks and they were blocking some kind of tunnel behind it. He shone his flashlight through the section he dug out, and there was absolutely some kind of sprawling area behind. He wanted me to go and explore it with him. Barely knowing him, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing so (I cannot adequately express how creepy this structure was), but to this day I have never forgotten this.

    Thinking about this today, I began to research to see if I could find the home he lived in. I believe I located it, and was SHOCKED when I Googled the address + tunnel and found this website (as well as an old map of the line), as the street the home is on is the exact street this tunnel supposedly runs under. I‚Äôm incredibly curious if, this was in fact, a hidden/blocked-off access point that isn‚Äôt well known, or something else entirely. Just wanted to share this!

    What memories this brings. I go way back with these.

    My mom took me to the Mee Hong restaurant from when I was about 5 years old in the early 1950s until the mid 1970s. She knew the owners and had been going there since the early 1940s. It was near the Arcade. When you walked in, the first thing you noticed was the lighting. The ceiling was white with recessed circular spaces with blue flourescent lighting. It was genius. The blue light reflected off the ceiling and gave this air of calm and serenity which I have experienced nowhere else. Though it was a small restaurant, the wall paper from ceiling to floor had scenes of ancient China with mountains, fields, valleys, so you were transported to a serene realm of relaxation and reflection. The food was delicious. You left that place fully relaxed and refreshed.
    
    We also went to Ming Gardens many times, starting in the mid 1950s when they were across the street and a block up from the Outlet, on a second floor above where there used to be a bookstore in the 1960s. Again my mother knew the owner from way back, regretfully I‚Äôve forgotten his name. Years later, after they had moved next to the People‚Äôs Savings bank, I recall meeting the owner again. He was then in his 90s but had that same sublime look that he always had. I asked him how he was and he astounded me by remembering who I was and that I used to go there as a child at the other location.
    
    Lastly I recall the Chinese restaurant on a small side street to the rear of the Providence City Hall. The food there was always good and quite reasonably priced. It was there one day that I heard two young Chinese women speaking in a language of almost unearthly beauty. I asked them what it was and they both laughed at my puzzlement, but neither spoke English. This was in the early 1960‚Äôs. I learned later that it was Cantonese, a dialect of Chinese which to me is far more beautiful than Mandarin could ever hope to be.
    
    The coming of the meter maids and probably a corrupted city administration in the 1980s probably ruined it for many small businesses. At the same time many historical buildings were razed just to make more parking lots. This was a combination that only accelerated the decline of what was once a small but great metropolis. What a pity. But still, that can‚Äôt take away from the wonderful memories of many many people.

My mother would take the train to providence to go to work when she lived at home in central fall. Later she would take me to providence to have my picture taken when I was about five. Later when it closed in 1959 the railroad installed steel stairs down to the platforms. I remember a deer got impaled on the spikes of the 6‚Äô cast iron fence the police had to take out its misery. It took a tow truck to get it off. My friends and would play around the tracks put pennies to see them get flattened.

It was my first encounter with a ‚Äúdead mall‚Äù and even in ‚Äò03-06, this place was the textbook definition of one. Even as a kid, it was pretty easy to figure out that Warwick Mall played some part as to why this place was a ghost town. Looking back on my own times there, it was just a bizarre place. EB Games and the Toy Vault were really the only reasons I‚Äôd have been compelled to go there, and it was a fine excuse to hoof across the parking lot to Toys R Us or Chuck E. Cheese afterwards. My mom liked going to some off-price clothing store in the back corner by the stairs (you can actually see it in the last picture with the racks out front) and I recall the place by the fountain where they served bagels ‚Äî literally the only food available at this mall during that time. It almost seemed full of life still, with the fountains, escalators, and elevators still running under the floods of natural light, and yet hardly anything or anyone was there. Then, there was the giant partition wall just slapped across the big staircase on the way to what would‚Äôve been Filenes at one point. Reading the history years later as to why that wall was there, makes it all seem a bit more sad ‚Äî especially now that the mall is completely gone.'

Later in high school, I‚Äôd go up there with my friends and try to be cool üòÉ. Are at Wings to Go and Spikes too much. The Army Navy store was a blast to poke around in. In your Ear was the first real record store I ever went into. I still have things from Oop on display at my house today.


Later in life when visiting RI I‚Äôd always make a visit to Thayer. Often bring friends from college to a place I thought was cooler than anywhere they had been before üòÉ. My best memories are from lunch or dinner with my mom at Andrea‚Äôs. She loved that place and got in a habit of stopping in when she‚Äôd see something at the Avon.

After the mill closed and the mills moved to the South where the cotton was grown, it later turned into a large retail outlet, like WalMart. I believe it was the first such place of its kind. My sister-in-law worked there. I remember the price tags that people learned to switch on items until they developed a tag that would tear when trying to switch. I used the parking lot in the winter to learn to drive in snow and ice as I did figure eights and learned how to steer into a skid. We spent lots of time in Olneyville. My first bank account was with the Old Stone Bank. The New York System Weiners was THE place. 10 cents each, three for a quarter. The large Star Market with all its smells. The below ground duck pin bowling alley. The Western Auto Store for my bicycle parts and repairs. It was a great place to grow up and was safe as any place back then. I attended the Boys Club most evenings.


Most of my family, back several generations worked the mills from Canada to Massachusetts, and down to Rhode Island. We are of French Canadian descent. Thanks for the opportunity to ramble for awhile. And thank you for your preservation interest.'

Being 19 yrs. old, we decided to race each other to the top floor up the stairwell. After several minutes we reached the top floor. Peeking thru the door we discovered that all office floors were below us and we had reached a maintenance level. Sneaking past some maintenance workers, we went up one more level. When we opened the door we found ourselves on the roof! The view was great. We could see to Fall River and the bridges down the bay. We stayed on the roof, undetected, for over a half hour, scoping out the horizons and the city below us. There is a 3 1/2 foot wall which angles out from the top and makes it impossible to see the sidewalk immediately below. But that didn‚Äôt stop one of my friends from trying, by leaning out and over the wall as far as he could. We resisted the tempation to lob coins down, but we at least had to spit over the side a few times. After a while, we sneaked back down the stairwell and out of the building. Nobody ever knew we were up there - until now. Imagine getting caught being up there today? We‚Äôd surely be put in Gitmo.'

Goldy‚Äôs, In Your Ear and Tom‚Äôs were THE places to get serious vinyl, I spent Saturday afternoons and evening there. Stromboli‚Äôs, the old McDonald‚Äôs, the Wendy‚Äôs and the Taco Maker were awesome. Even Ben and Jerry‚Äôs and d‚ÄôAngelo‚Äôs had their own special appeal being on Thayer St.

We used to have a street called The Drag‚Ä¶ a long stretch of record shops, cafes, bars and bookstores, with an open-air crafts market. Punks, crusties, weirdos, artists, homeless people, students and professors all mingled on the broad sidewalk. In the 70s, it was the cosmic cowboy scene, and in the 60s, hippies and rock and roll. The Drag was the place where it all happened. There is not one thing left on it now to suggest that history to the transient student population, and it‚Äôs really sad. They know no better than ‚ÄúWhich Wich Sandwiches‚Äù and ‚ÄúChipotle‚Äù and Urban Outfitters. I have dreamed for years of doing a historical project about The Drag and love what you have done here.


When I first walked down Thayer St a few years ago, I noticed that while it still has more local character than remains on The Drag, that Urban Outfitters and Johnny Rockets had moved in and that a good record store had recently closed. I felt sad, as if I was looking at the Drag on the brink again. There is something left of Thayer St, though‚Ä¶ is perhaps not too late to save it?


In Austin, groups of independent businesses (book and record stores, mostly) in other parts of town formed a coalition called ‚ÄúKeep Austin Weird‚Äù to raise awareness and promote the idea among locals of shopping locally. It was in the early millenium, and a tech boom was sending new money and homogeneity washing over the city with the waves of new arrivals. I think the campaign was pretty successful ‚Äî those businesses seem to be going strong, and Austin‚Äôs had other interesting areas spring up and survive, but all this came after the mallification and bankification of The Drag.


Maybe a public information campaign in Providence could make things a bit rougher for the soul-sucking chains and could keep things friendlier to the little businesses? Maybe I‚Äôm dreaming? A series of before and after posters? T shirt/bumper sticker campaign? Boycotts?'

the picture of the cvs makes me sad. that was the location of the old thayer market. a great neighborhood grocery with cashiers and butchers that knew your name and were friends. they were good people who cared about the east side community. they often helped my mom out when we were going through a tough patch by letting her put groceries on account, sometimes just letting it slide knowing she was more than a long time customer but a neighbor trying to feed five kids. bless them for that. i doubt you‚Äôll find that at cvs or anywhere else on thayer anymore. my mom cryed when they closed, as did many an east sider i‚Äôm sure.


there used to be a great toy store, ‚Äúthe merry go round‚Äù, upstairs in the store shown in # 6.  that‚Äôs where every east side kid got his birthday presents from, that or ‚Äúbrodsky‚Äôs‚Äù but that was in a different part of town entirely.


down the block just past the dunkin donuts was a great old barber shop, ‚Äúalbarunci‚Äôs‚Äô (sp).  many a boy had their first, tearful (or maybe that was just me it was the late 60‚Äôs after all).


on the other side of the street upstairs from berk‚Äôs was an arcade that copped alot of quarters from the restless youth of the east side.  downstairs was a pizza place that had all you could eat spaghetti specials on wednesday.  that was the spot for the pre-game meal no matter what the season.


and as a side note my brother actually once owned and ran ‚Äúhole in the wall deli‚Äù mentioned in #6.  long before that, when we were kids it was at one time one of the first ‚Äúsubway‚Äù franchises.'

My friends and I used to go there after a double feature at the Avon for about $5.00. We would go see Hair, Rock n Roll High School, Tommy. One Friday I did eight hours (3movies) The first movie started at 6pm, Woodstock; the second movie was Monty Python‚Äôs Life of Brian; then the midnight show was Quadrophenia. I had to go to Penguins (a great coffee shop across the street where Kabob & Curry is) to get a hot tea before the midnight movie to refuel.


Also, in front of the Brown Bookstore used to be a wall. ‚ÄúThe wall‚Äù was a frequent hangout for us after school.

It was 1968 and I lived at 373 Thayer, right at the beginning, where it breaks off from Hope Street. It was one of many apartments I would have on the East Side, but because it was my first, it holds great memories. There were four of us living there, in a wild apartment, in wild times. At the risk of coming off like a relic, I will give you an idea of how long ago it all was. One of our roommates would gather up his favorite albums and walk down to Brown, where he would do his radio show from a little campus station called WBRU. Want an idea of how small the station was? We couldn‚Äôt hear it on the radio waaaay up on the other side of Thayer ‚Äî it was for campus listeners only! Another great Thayer memory? We left for a concert in upstate New York from our apartment on Thayer, all packed into a VW camper. My 16-year-old sister was visiting me from Florida and she came along. Little did we know that the concert would turn out to be Woodstock. Laugh. Out. Loud. When we pulled back into our little driveway on Thayer, we had all been changed forever. Thayer Street in those days was amazing. No GAP, no Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, no glossy chain retailers. It was the real deal, boys and girls. But you know what? Thayer Street ‚Äî and our lives ‚Äî will always be a changing work of art. Someday, you will tell your story like I‚Äôm telling mine. Ob-la-di‚Ä¶ ob-la-da‚Ä¶'

I won‚Äôt wax nostalgic about all the things we did on Thayer, and how important it was for us to have that place to go. The person I was on Thayer Street 12 years ago would hate me for doing that. Instead, I will say that the passing of time never seems so vivid as when you visit the landscapes of a time that‚Äôs past, of a time you‚Äôve left, and you see that it too has changed. And done so without you.


Thank you for preserving those changes here on this site. Thayer Street in the 90‚Äôs was a stage whereupon so many of us acted out the dramas of lives in that time, and served as a staging ground for where we‚Äôve ended up (even if we‚Äôve never left, or never looked back).

You‚Äôd wake up on a Saturday morning, say ‚ÄúMa, I‚Äôm going to Thayer st,‚Äù walk or take the bus, and walk around to see who was around. Inevitably you‚Äôd run into some people you knew, along with some no ones from else where in the state, and by night time, if you weren‚Äôt still loitering on the corner, you were off on some adventure somewhere else. But its where it all formulated, and fit in perfectly with American 1990s culture, and the rise of grunge/punk/indie music, shops, etc‚Ä¶ Its where you went after school, its where you hung out when you didn‚Äôt want to be at home and had nothing to do. Its where you‚Äôd use the pay-phones and say ‚Äúmeet me in front of Store 17.‚Äù It was exactly what an angst ridden 90s teen wanted. In the 80s, it had seen the rise of that very culture, until it exploded, and then they built a mall downtown. I guess thats where the kids these days hang out, and that sucks. Thayer st. has been completely revised since the millennium, and its sad to watch how quickly they‚Äôve killed a place that played such an important role in a lot of kids growing up. As an adult, I still head there everyday when ever I am in Providence. Its automatic. But its a business district. You can go and get a good lunch, and find a minimum wage job there. The culture is pretty null these dulls, but I figure as an adult on a Wednesday morning, its always seemed pretty much the same. Still, the run off from the mall is disheartening.'

My first recollection of Thayer Street is vivid and it was in the Spring of 1994. The feeling beckons back to the Grunge period in music and a far less mainstream influence in fashions. The crowd was motley but hip. It was an atmosphere where people could identify with music, art, and undisputed cool culture. The few times I have strolled up and down Thayer Street, recently, I have noticed more Abercrombie Zombies milling about. They‚Äôve migrated from the suburban malls and staked their claim on the once sacred grounds of the punk rockers, artists, hipsters, and innovative free-thinkers. I embrace change and transition, but not of this kind. I have a feeling it‚Äôll never be the same.'

we also conducted a ‚Äústudy‚Äù to see if it was true that if people see someone looking they will look to and to see how strong the power of suggestion really is‚Ä¶ we stood outside near Berk‚Äôs and stared across the street at the flat roofs and whispered and pointed to one another. 117 people stopped to look in 20 minutes.

As I remember, our  pink, L-shaped house, a combination of two quarters, was located across from a field that was in front of one side of the fort. I think the house is gone now because I can‚Äôt find a house that shape anywhere in Google Earth. We used to love to go exploring the fort. Some of the walls had pieces of old wallpaper. We had no idea what the rooms were used for so it was fun to speculate what went on there. My neighbor and I would go over to the fort early in the morning to run the wide open space. It was fun to go through the fort to see the sailboats. I will submit a few photos I found of the fort. I wish I had more!'

The architecture is from the 1880s and even if it had a Fire Service history and was used during the horse drawn years (which ended in the 1920s), horses and apparatus would have been stored on the first floor. Their human counterparts lived on the second floor of fire houses as they still do.

Making it over into micro-lofts is a violence to its original design, which was meant to be open to the public, not closed-off and private. In its early 19th century capitalist glory, the Arcade was a temple to mercantile, Jacksonian democracy, where all ‚Äî well, not all ‚Äî but certain Americans were considered equal to any others. Personally I think it would be an excellent repository of the state and local archives, almost 4OO years of colony/state and local archives probably mouldering away in official attics and basements. MA built itself a new site for its state archives, but RI has none. Certainly nothing modern. If this is the only way the Arcade survives (until its next crisis) well and good: look what happened to Providence National Bank. Maybe (hopefully) it survives this latest metamorphosis, into a future that appreciates it.'

That was the age of nunchucks, Chinese throwing stars, Rambo knives, heavy metal tapestries, Army-Navy surplus, that place had it all. We spent every weekend in there, scouring through thousands of baseball cards, cassettes, etc. My dad was a beer can collector back then. We would go into the old horse stables and pull the planks off the wall, because the jockeys would throw their beer cans up over the top plank, and they‚Äôd fall down in between the walls. There were all kinds of vintage Narragansett cans in those walls, and thousands of hypodermic needles. Great memories in that place.'

In the late 70‚Äôs the owners were renting it out for music concerts and to the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, who used it for their yearly conventions for a few years. When the concerts were going on, you could hear them from my house, and people would park all along our street, I suppose to avoid having to pay for parking. After the race track went out of business, it was a great flea market for a few years, until the mid 80‚Äôs, when Building 19 went in. I missed the flea market, but I liked that store. Their ads were a hoot! I wasn‚Äôt living in that neighborhood by that time, but I still shopped there often, until about 2010 or so. I was sorry to hear that they went out of business.'

In a similar fashion to Filenes they ended up closing the Rhode Island Mall branch last month (leaving the stores remaining at five). Of the five, two of the store have locations at the Warwick mall (Lenscrafters, and GNC), the other three; Sears, H&R Block, and First Place sports. In addition Sears put up a partition wall within the last couple of days, preventing people from directly entering the mall. Asking an associate about it, she was mentioning that the wall was put up for fire protection. further talking about the mall, she noted that the reason why there is no new tenets is due to the cost of modernizing the building to comply with new fire code regulations. Not sure if its the truth, but with the walls on both sides of the mall, the main hall is now in grave condition.'

Incredulous, I said ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make any sense!‚Äù Apparently 10 years ago, the Wal-Mart that is currently there was supposed to be a Super Wal-Mart like the one located in Coventry. The owners of Stop and Shop declared that a Super Wal-Mart would severely hamper their business. Thus the owners of Stop and Shop decided it would be cheaper to just make a 20 year lease of every store space in that damned mall to keep Wal-Mart from being huge and *Gasp* hurting Stop and Shop and their overpriced rubbish. He also told me Stop and Shop is looking to break the lease soon which will allow stores to move back in there so there is hope very soon for this mall.'

I actually remember the decline of the mall. My very first job was at the Cherry &amp; Webb inside the mall. Even then ‚Äì with a GAP and Filene‚Äôs, and no Wal-Mart, the mall was empty. It had long since lost its customer base to the Warwick Mall (and this was years before the Providence Place Mall was completed). Cherry &amp; Webb was on the 1st floor, but when a store upstairs had closed up, we moved into the upstairs space as well. The upstairs was our ‚ÄúClearance Department‚Äù.


I worked in that haven to Alfred Dunner sportswear for just under a year in 1997, when I was 16 years old.

He told us the car dealer gave him the knife when he bought the car new. I never saw or heard of these knives again until 2004 when I started restoring a 1950 Chevrolet. The previous owner told me he had no keys for the car. When I started to remove sections of the body for the restoration project, I found an Imperial pen knife with a Chevrolet logo and a cut key blank. The key fit the locks in the car. I finally finished the car in 2009. During the time of working on the car I accumulated several more knives. I also learned that Curtis Industries of Cleveland made the blanks for these knives. I don‚Äôt go to many car shows with my car, but when I do, the big attraction is the Key Knife in the ignition. Not many of the folks have seen these knives.'

During the 1970s and later, as a stay-at-home Mom, I worked part-time at Peerless and at the Things Remembered Kiosk. Christmas was crazy! I took my kids to see Randy the talking Reindeer, and of course, to see Santa Claus. My friends and I used to go walking EVERY MORNING before the stores opened to exercise and window shop! I remember Roast House, Fanny Farmer Chocolates, and Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. My kiddos loved Papa Gino‚Äôs. We‚Äôd take in a movie (recalling Honey I Shrunk the Kids) and get a bite to eat afterward. There was something for everyone. It felt manageable‚Ä¶ far better than the huuuuuge malls we have now a-days. I moved from Rhode Island in 1996, but that was a great place to go with a family!'

On the lower lever towards the far right corner was an air hockey table. Just behind and to the right was a basketball free throw machine. I also spent quite a few dollars at the theater across the way. Just up from the theater was India Optical and at the very end of that entry hall was the piano and organ store. I‚Äôd let my girlfriend go do her shopping while I listened to the customers and salespeople play those pianos and organs. In picture 1 of the photos, there was a stage setup that featured a traveling Beatles tribute band called Beatlemania. They played around four shows over a weekend. I saw their tour back around 1977. Just a side note here, but the remnant members of the Beatlemania show were the first band to play at the United Kingdom pavilion at Walt Disneyworld. Of course, none of the original cast still play there. I recall the fantastic baseball card store. I really, really miss Lincoln Mall back in its glory days.

I as well as other‚Äôs got our parted in the middle and feathered hair cuts at the salon across from the Magic Menu.

It‚Äôs basically a shell/retail wasteland between three large stores, two of which want no physical connection to the mall as I am sure they‚Äôve seen the handwriting. Back in The Day, Lincoln and Midland Malls, on a Saturday were da bomb. Every kid and his family loved just hanging around and walking by the gauntlets of suited salesmen in the Sears TV Dept which is now (what‚Äôs left of Sears which is K-Mart, essentually) all basically self service. Those guys all had CAREERS at places like Sears when it was more than a job to them. I even suspect Warwick Mall is on the decline ‚Äì one end (what used to be Jordan Marsh/Macys) of it is almost deserted. The saddest fate I ever saw of what was the granddaddy of ALL malls was in Rochester NY, a downtown mall that was the model for such malls as Midland, was now a shell filled with what amounted to flea markets inside of what were always polished and shining shoe stores (Florsheim) or candy shops (Fanny Farmer). There was a used/new CD/DVD store and, a joke shop, and‚Ä¶ oddly, a quite active food court.


A hotel employee where I stayed said this place was BIG in the 60‚Äôs through the mid-80‚Äôs and fell into decline fast as the 90‚Äôs wore on and the sprawl of Target, Walmart, continued. He said it was like dominoes how they all left or went under.'

When I was a teen, I would head up there with my friends and catch a movie (when they were like $4), spend all my money at the Dream Machine (always wanted to work there) and grab a bite to eat at Papa Ginos or a shake from the Magic Menu. I still didn‚Äôt understand why they had a Lowery organ store there but can still remember that guy playing all day long just to get customers to come into the store.

For that year we had a blast exploring Fort Adams and the Redoubt. There were some keep out signs posted but we snuck into the fort all the time and did our best to avoid getting caught by the park rangers. We called them ‚ÄúRent-a-Cops‚Äù and sometimes we would intentionally let them see us peering over the fort walls so we could run and hide from them. We walked through the tunnels and checked out all the living quarters etc. not having any idea of the historical significance it held.


There are a few things that I thought were really cool. Well the whole place is cool, but these really stood out. There was a 2 lane bowling alley and you could see where someone stood at the end of each lane and set up pins and rolled the balls back down a ramp to the bowlers. There was a little room in a short tower that had a ceiling made up of a bunch of blue glass circles that looked like the bottoms of coke bottles. When the sun was shining it would cast a blue hue in the room. it appeared to be a lookout post, but we never understood the blue glass. I remember the flooded tunnels in both the Redoubt and the main fort. We always assumed they connected to each other.


I remember the remnants of a draw bridge over the dry moat at the entrance to the Redoubt. We used a long 2x12 as a bridge to get across. Inside there was a crumbling stone spiral staircase going up to a small platform. We assumed that was some kind of lookout post. Maybe the most interesting thing we found was in the eastern face of one of the earthen berms. There was a steel door leading into an underground hallway with a number of rooms on either side. One of the rooms was ‚ÄúThe Map Room‚Äù. There was a long sheet of iron hanging on the wall with a hand painted map of the Narragansett Bay area complete with old English lettering and names of locations that were still recognizable. It was probably at least 20 feet long by 8 feet high. Very cool.


We used to have soccer practice in the field close to the Redoubt. Our coach would start every practice with a run around the fort and then down to the anchors at the entrance to the park area and then back. We were there when the tall ships came to Newport as part of the USA bicentennial celebration. We were also there during the America‚Äôs Cup yacht races and used to watch them sail out every day to go race. Awesome memories.'

I knew the Fort better than most people. I was employed by the state at slave labor rates the first year construction of the parking lots was started. My fondest memories are of the tunnels also. They are laid out very simple, in fact I could run, in the dark, without a flashlight and ‚Äúcut off‚Äù any one in front of me proceeding at too slow a pace. Which is what I did on my first day of work as the ‚Äúrestoration expert‚Äù was showing them to us interns. The look on his face when his flashlight lit me up in front of him‚Ä¶ he slammed his head in the ceiling‚Ä¶ and I wondered why we had kinda a testy relationship that summer. The tunnels had two ‚Äútraps‚Äù occasionally the ceiling dropped to about 4‚Äô from 5‚Äô the best I can tell is if you didn‚Äôt know they were there you smashed your skull into them. The other was a circular stair that had a step missing 1/2 way up. You learned to count steps, and it was no problem running in the dark if you knew about them. The tunnels are whistle clean once you got in a 100‚Äô or so‚Ä¶ What I never found was the tunnel to the redoubt, but I know its there, and I had a old blueprint that I got from a friend at the navy public works building that showed it.'

Wandering through the narrow, underground passages with a single flashlight, wading through ankle deep water and imagining the ghosts of soldiers past was quite a thrill. We used to fear getting lost in the bowels of the fort, but that, of course, was part of the thrill (much like the <a href="/property/east-side-train-tunnel/">East Side tunnel</a> which also has a large part in the backdrop of my teen years in the ‚Äô86 -‚Äô88 period). On one memorable occasion, we had packed backpacks for a long day planned of exploring and donned boots to ward off the (real or imagined) rats and I picked up a bottle of some unknown origin and commenced to throw it, Molotov cocktail-style across a dimly lit passage. Whatever foul, congealed substance was in it came out and covered my head and torso. Needless to say, I ripped off my shirt (a blue turtleneck, I recall) and wiped my face and threw the shirt away. I had another in the backpack‚Ä¶ refitted, I gamely chose to not dwell on the horror and moved on with our combination game/exploration.

  content: 'The J.B.Barnaby‚Äôs Castle‚Äôs carriage house was completed in 1875, designed by Stone, Carpenter and Wilson, a prominent and prestigious architectural firm in Providence. In the same theme of elaborate and exuberant design as the main mansion it belonged to, the Carriage house had many exceptional details added to its functional purpose as the stable for J.B. Barnaby‚Äôs horses and carriages. Some of the details include the 10 foot rosette window in the center location of the second floor. This is surrounded by colorful Italian tiles that give it a Moorish look to the building. The building is made of brick and granite. The tack room, originally simply the area that the tack for the horses and carriages were kept, had floor to ceiling mahogany walls with alternating shades of light and dark mahogany. There is a high shelf below the ceiling to this room which is also made of mahogany with intricate carvings and the initials of JB Barnaby over the entrance door carved in large ‚Äúold English‚Äù lettering. The floor of the tack room is made of porcelian tiles which were very popular at the time and has an intricate, colorful, and fanciful mosiac pattern. Each floor of the carriage house is 4000 sq feet and all the wood of the walls are mahogany and the floor on the second floor is the original yellow pine.


The buliding was used over the years for many commercial purposes‚Ä¶ ice house, storage building for a commercial painting company etc. In 1997 the buliding was bought and renovations begun to make it a residence for the 1st time in 122 years. The top floor was renovated keeping the openess and spirit of the carriage house design intact. As many original details were left wherever possible. On Dec 23rd 1997 the first Christmas tree was lit in the large rosette window. In Feb 1998 a wedding was held there, (actually the second wedding was perfomed there. The first wedding being held back when JB Barnaby owned the house and one of his daughters was married there.) The owners of the carriage house continued the renovations, calling the building their ‚Äúmini mansion‚Äù. With great care and love for this masterpiece of a building, 100s of hours went into creating a space worthy of the original design. On May 12, 2002 the owner was tradgically killed by a drunk driver and his wife was forced to sell the building. The house was bought and the new owner is making changes to the house too.


My husband and I loved that carriage house and felt very lucky to be able to live there and create a home from a structure that at one time was a ‚Äúone of a kind‚Äù carriage house. The craftsmanship and detail that the artisians of yesteryears put into these fabulous buildings makes anything built today pales in comparison. Buildings did not go up in 3 months like they do today but took years to complete and every detailed masterfully crafted. When we first went to get homeowners insurance the company came back with a replacement figure just based on putting up another building the same size. They said it would be impossible to fix a replacement value for it since it would cost millions of dollars to build it the same today. One of the great things about living in the carriage house is that it appears to the outside world that nothing is happening there, but obviously there was alot going on in there for the 5 years I lived there!'

The house‚Äôs garage is used by a woman who drives a blue or black BMW, and man in, if I recall, a black Lincoln Town Car. When the big doors are opened, inside looks like any ol garage, with dusty stuff strewn about. Upstairs is functional and might be someone‚Äôs private apartment. I think it‚Äôs more of a high-end private party space for the high-end people of the club. I have seen on more than one occasion through the big round window lit chandeliers and people in suits holding drinks. Also, the mansion next door is a private residence ‚Äî one old man lives in it. It was apartments in the 70s and 80s (this is a local rumor ‚Äì but the side door has several door bells, and at night only one or two rooms are lit on the second floor. so the rumors have a little support).'

  content: 'This is one of the really outstanding examples of why groups like SWAP are so important. Both the carriage house and the palace it‚Äôs attached to are some of the most fabulous examples of Victorian architecture you‚Äôll find anywhere, right on a busy commercial and residential strip, in an up-and-coming district, yet the main house sits there vacant and the carriage house seems rarely used. Being a stylish piece of architecture that happens to be owned by a long time resident who has a sentimental attachment to it, in my opinion, doesn‚Äôt make it much different from a triple decker with hardly any paint left on it, or a brick-and-granite turn of the century mercantile block sitting empty on Weybosset Street. It‚Äôs still empty, still taking up space for nothing, and still a waste of valuable real estate (by this I mean mainly the house, not this carraige house, as it seems to be occipied. Just my two cents.'

According to the document I found listing possible national historic buildings in Pawtucket, his store moved into the building in 1915 and was remodeled in art deco style in 1923. My mother (Sally Simpson McDevitt Cunneen) remembered visiting the store as a girl in the 1920s and 30s and being very impressed with what a big and fancy department store it was. William H. McDevitt lived until 1940, I believe. He is listed on the wall of contributing founders in the old main building at Providence College, having given money to help create a Catholic College on RI. I believe his son William J. McDevitt took over running the store. and that his branch of the family have remained successful businesspeople in Rhode Island down til today. William H. is buried in in the McDevitt family plot, together with my grandparents (John N. McDevitt & Marguerite O‚ÄôCallaghan McDevitt) in St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket.'

  content: 'Your description of the design of the original Union Station is quite incorrect. It was definitely not ‚Äúflanked by two graceful towers on one end, and an octagonal pavilion on the other‚Äù. The design was perfectly symmetrical on each side of the centerline. The large towers were set at either side of the central facade of the main building. There were also two wings which branched off from the main building at a slight angle ‚Äì one on the east (Boston) side and another on the west (New York) side. Each of the wings consisted of a large train shed covering four tracks and terminated on the street side in a two-story octagonal pavilion with a round external stair tower. A famous 1861 photograph of the 2nd RI Volunteers on parade in front of the station prior to boarding trains to take them south to fight in the Civil War shows the east end of the station to be a perfect mirror image of the west end as shown in your photographs. I have a fairly good copy of that photo in my files which I can send to you, if you‚Äôd like to have it. Photos of Union Station were almost invariably taken from in front of the building, and rarely from the sides. Because the focus in this photo was on the troops, the station was just part of the whole scene. It‚Äôs the most detailed photo I‚Äôve ever seen of the train sheds which were at both ends of the station.


(**A.I.R.**: While this was not our description, this is an existing description of the first Union Station designed by Thomas Tefft from a well-respected architectural historian. While it seems like it was incredibly symmetrical to us as well, we respect the way it was described, even though it may paint an inaccurate picture.)'

As I walked in through the main door, it was totally silent. There were some desks but something wasn‚Äôt quite right. I shouted ‚Äúhello‚Äù several times but it remained totally silent with no response. Then I noticed the desks, the office furniture was from the 1940‚Äôs, ancient metal file cabinets, old reclining wooden office chairs, metal desks with old rotary phones on them, many with a mechanical adding machine complete with crank! Finally, as I was about to leave, I encountered the janitor who directed me upstairs to the second floor where jewelry operations were still going on. They were still using RPG, an old IBM macro language I would not touch if you paid me, thanked them and left, still astounded that they could not keep a receptionist on at the front office.'

As summer employees, we worked in their stock and shipping rooms. pulling costume jewelry items already placed in plastic bags from bins and packaging them in cartons for shipment by truck. We also worked in the storage rooms where newly manufactured items were stored in metal buckets or pans and the main function would be to dump the pans into a funnel-type contraption that fed down to the lower floor where the packaging department was located. I distinctly recall climbing the stairs to the upper floors where we worked and passing the manufacturing floors where the din of the machines was almost unbearable. This was my first taste of blue collar work and inspired me and my brother to go on to college and law school so that we would never need to work in such a gloomy building doing menial, mechanical, and boring tasks. The building was old, had high ceilings, worn wooden floors and tall frosted windows. The place gives me the chills just remembering it! The surrounding area was occupied by decrepit multi-story apartment houses that obviously boarded factory workers and their families for decades past. My brother and I could hardly wait for summer‚Äôs end! I remember seeing both cheap and expensive pieces of jewelry, mostly the former, and at the end of our stay, we never wanted to see costume jewelry again.'

  content: 'It all began in late June of 1955 with an interview with Charlie Vaughn, Jr. and Dick Vaughn. They reviewed some of my schoolwork relating to woodworking. I had just graduated from high school that month and this would be my first real job. They did hire me at $1.17 per hour. I was but seventeen years old and was not allowed to start my apprenticeship or run any machinery until I was eighteen. Because of the age restriction, time was spent tying-up stock for shipping, catching material off the molders and planers, cleaning up sawdust and cut-offs, and working in the glue room. During that time I worked just about everywhere in that four-story building and got to meet, and begin to know, most all of the some eighty employees. It was quite an eye opening experience. The guys presented a wide spectrum of age, races, traditions, abilities, attitudes, appearances and idiosyncrasies. Even with all that diversity they all worked hard and well with each other. It seemed to me like a pretty happy family. I realized later on that when someone was hired or left, everyone was interested who the new man was or why the man was leaving and these occurrences did not happen very often. I felt comfortable in this environment.


As my apprenticeship commenced, my initial work was in stock cutting, which meant taking the rough lumber and sizing it to the dimensions required for molding or assembly. Once that phase was learned, I was periodically assigned to the ‚ÄúSash Department‚Äù where windows were made, ‚ÄúFrame Department‚Äù where various types of window frames were constructed, to the ‚ÄúCabinet Department‚Äù where all types of casework was manufactured and finally to the ‚ÄúStair Department‚Äù where specialty items were fabricated. This amounted to making plastic laminate items, bow windows, sailboats, bell-shaped gazebo roofs, circular stairs and stair-parts, etc. This was a wonderful classroom to learn how to fabricate many things and presented many challenges.


Upon completion of my apprenticeship in August of 1959, I worked out the year in my home, the Stair Department. There was but 6 of us and we thoroughly enjoyed one another. One day in late December my boss told me I was to report to the Engineering Department the first workday in January. An employee in ‚ÄúEngineering‚Äù had passed away and I was to replace him. I was in awe! I could not believe that this was possible. This step placed me in a position of opportunity that was daunting. I found, however, that the department, made up of 7 men, all took me under their wing, helped me through my trials and tribulations with laughs and pats on the back, I really found a new home.


From 1960 through 1966 there was a lot of work coming in and our staff was increased by two more. During that time L. Vaughn Company got a huge job, The Sheraton Boston Hotel, which provided much of the capital needed to take us from Westminster Street to Jefferson Blvd. The new building allowed us to do things much more efficiently and grow in volume.  This increased our marketable area to a radius which extended south to North Carolina and west to Ohio and all in between. As years past the company had much success with very minor ups and downs.


By October of 1985 situations and another opportunity lead me to leave L. Vaughn Company. Those past 30 years had provided me with many fond memories and good times with good people from top to bottom.'

  content: 'I worked for the L Vaughn Company several summers in the early 1950‚Äôs as an office boy. In particular I remember how the power to run the woodworking equipment was a marvel of energy conservation:


All of the sawdust from the many operations was collected by a large vacuum system into a silo at the rear. This highly combustable byproduct was blown into a steam boiler where it exploded into flame. The steam ran on old Corless Steam engine with two horizontal cylinders. This in turn was connected by a vertical series of shafts, pulleys and steel cables to the upper floors. On the ceilings of each floor were a complex of shafts and pulleys which connected to the equipment on the floor with leather belt drives. The machines were turned on and off by ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù the belt onto the ceiling pulley with a wooden pole, a common arrangement in many New England mills of the 1800‚Äôs. The whole process, sawdust to steam to shaft to cutting tools to sawdust generated more sawdust power than was necessary, and the excess sawdust was sold to a local farmer. Earlier in the 1900‚Äôs an elecric generator was also connected to the steam engine and provided electric power for the buildings and newer equipment. Later, Narragensett Electric replaced the in-house generator when it burned out, but the belt drive system continued in use.


The elevators in the building were also powered by the belt drive system. and if the load was too heavy, the belt would slip and the elevator stall. On occasion I would take a customer out on the shop floor to see how their particular project, such as a bay window or a curved staircase was progressing. Frequently we used the elevator, and sometimes it would stall out between the second and third floors with distressing groans and jerks, causing some apprehension to the ladies or gentlemen on board. (Which  of course I secretly enjoyed!). I explained that the only recourse was to go back down to the first floor and then walk up. Of course the elevator went down faster that it had gone up and rattled and shook in new and different ways. But all ended well, These custom jobs were of the highest craftsmanship and the customers were always pleased.'

Orange velour bedspreads, a foam padded headboard, indoor/outdoor carpeting, mismatched flea market furniture, itty bitty bath towels, two water glasses and a lone ashtray comprised our room decor. It was hysterically, absurdly amusing. BUT‚Ä¶ the VIEW from our third floor window was worth dealing with anything‚Ä¶ hands down.


The ocean was simply SPECTACULAR everywhere we looked. It went forever and then some. Directly outside our door in the hallway was the exterior door to the roof‚Ä¶¬†need I say more?? The ocean and the stars surrounded us in our forever love. We continued to visit every August for the next ten years. Bereft to hear it was being torn down, but elated to know it would be rebuilt. That is, until we fully understood we were out. Yes. It is, for us, truly overdone to the hilt. Affordable?? Not in this lifetime.  Thankyouverymuch.


The ocean, sea sun & stars are still there, but obscured by the nonsense ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to justify the pricetag!! To those of you who do visit, don‚Äôt forget to look at the water once in awhile!!'

  content: 'Being from Westerly, I grew up in Misquamicut. My parents owned a small house on Atlantic Avenue, so I didn‚Äôt learn of the charm of the OH until my I reached my teens. One of my best friends, Henry, worked there, along with his brother and two girls with whom we were friends. In my teens, I visited my friends who worked there, and spent many nights with them at beach parties in front of the OH, complete with music, fires and tiki torches.


Nothing will ever replace the peace and quiet of the lobby; complete with that the musty/salty smell of the old building and summer air. You can‚Äôt describe that to anyone; you have to have enjoyed it while you were there.


Ironically, that summer, I also began to review my grandmother‚Äôs claims that she was born in Watch Hill. In picking her brain and looking in the local library, I learned that my 4th great grandfather was Jonathan Nash; long term keeper of the Watch Hill Light and father to George Nash, the builder of the Ocean House. That historical connection brought an added charm to my time there, and lent to my friends and I many jokes about their claims that the upper floors were haunted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre related.‚Äù (Rumor had it that my 4th great grandfather, Jonathan, had been laid to rest about where the front porch of the OH was, then moved in later years to River Bend Cemetary.)


As a member of the public, we were allowed to play bingo, at that time, with ‚ÄúAce‚Äù calling the numbers in the main ballroom. We played ping pong in the game room, and, in later years, could enjoy blues bands in the bar. Will the new OH lend its charm to the public? I certainly hope so, as that was one of the benefits of enjoying that local icon.


It broke my heart when the OH came down, but I, too, understand the limitations of renovating something so far deteriorated. I‚Äôve heard rumors of the new plans, and have yet to review the plans online. I can only hope that Mr. Royce will remember, as we all do, what we loved about the ocean house; it‚Äôs welcoming charm to distant travelers and locals alike; the gorgeous and majestic wrap-around deck with game tables and lounge chairs; the beach bar; the game room; and, of course, the breathtaking views. We‚Äôve placed our hopes that Mr. Royce constructs a building which will pay homage to the original building. I doubt, however, he will be able to replace that musty/salty smell of the lobby, or rebuild the atmosphere that took that over a hundred years to build.'

The beach sand felt like hot baby powder in your toes. The waves were always big enough to body surf and when you were ready to relax‚Ä¶ you could rest on your belly and stare at the most beautiful structure. The hotel was extrodinary. It made you feel like you could almost go back in time. There was something comforting about the old lopsided building and now it‚Äôs gone for ever.

Mr. Royce ‚Äì you are not just renovating a hotel ‚Äì you are saving a bit of history, culture and community. Thank you for your foresight and for recognizing the value of such a place to so many.

I was a high school junior at Jackson High School in Camden SC. a English teacher by the name of Mr. Mclester (Daddy Mac as he was so effectionly called) came to me to discuss a summer job in Rhode Island at a hotel. Daddy Mac had taught my parents as well as myself and my siblings. He was a scholar and a gentleman.


I could make a lot of money for next season school. Of he had to speak to my parents to get permission. And of course with his charm they said OK.


I still remember arriving at the grand hotel to work. At that time i do not remember ever setting foot in a hotel. I had never seen building so beautiful. As it turned out I worker the entire summer through labor day. I was late coming home to start school which began in August.


Daddy Mac as the head man there for us ‚Äúboys‚Äù was a great impression. I learned a lot from him that summer that I still keep close. Too bad he can not continue to train young men as did with me and others at the Ocean House Hotel. My life has been better as a result of him crossing my path. I could say more about Daddy Mac but I can not type as fast as the thoughts could to mine. God bless Daddy Mac.'

I am pleased the OH is under REBUILD: which means the historical structure will be rebuilt from scratch.

As we grew into our teenage years, my friends from out of town always looked forward to going back to the OH. Then the thrill became sneaking into the bar to see if we could pass for legal drinking age. Of course, the waiter or waitress was usually someone‚Äôs sister, neighbor, or cousin who knew better, so we‚Äôd end up settling for a Coke on the porch. I have many, many black and white 35 mm pictures of that porch, which was downright patrician. In high school one of them actually won an award; again I was thrilled. When it came time for my high school yearbook picture, I already knew where mine would be taken ‚Äì on the Ocean House porch, of course. It was the quintessential New England shot. Over the years the Ocean House became a bit of a has-been (the rooms stood still in a time I never knew!), but still the ?local? folks went there not only because it was one of the only places in town, but because it was habitual. I really hope the new Ocean House makes Watch Hill a world class vacation destination not only for visitors to RI, but for locals as well. I am looking forward to the day I can check in for a weekend of spa treatment: rest, relaxation, and good food, all less than 10-minutes from home.

In 1996 I discovered the Ocean House in Watch Hill and spent an enchanting 4 days there that August, absolutely falling in love with the place.

I will never forget running along down to the beach on the blinstering hot boards, having Sam come over with the chairs and umbrella, and letting the parents get settled while we rushed into the waves. I remember the older generation who would come for the season, some of whom seemed to spend hours standing out just past the break in quiet chest deep water. They taught us to hold our hands in certain ways and squeeze to make a splray of water come out like a fountain, and would chat with us like old friends on first meeting. My foster grandparents! Yes, truly a place one felt surrounded by love and expansiveness, where people were all about but one felt completely private and free. There is no place like it. I remember arriving the first night and leaving the window open to hear the lapping of the waves, and waking before everyone else to run to the window and peek out at the huge expanse of blue, blue ski, blue sea, what an incredible panorama. Grand architecture yet unassuming. Just perfect. And the sounds and smells of course, the waves, the FOOD, the whipoorwhils often heard from the patio in a rather wild section of side yard, the bunnies on the lawn in the morning, and hearing the banging of pots and pans and the singing and chatting rising up from the kitchens! fantastic memories.

  content: 'Where should I start about the wonderful days spent at the Ocean House? In 1939 we began going to the Ocean House and the love affair was immediate and absolute. To really appreciate the Ocean House you have to understand the people that went there as customers and the people who worked there with a single mission to make your vacation a memory for a life time.

Now you all know that we did not believe in segragation in the North but we did practice restricted clientele. No one would be turned down by the management but the kinds of guests could make a family feel either very comfortable or uncomfortable. Those that were comfortable would return year after year. Although there were people from ethinic groups, the majority were of Celtic origin and were in the upper middle class financally. To me a seven year old I could have cared less who came as long as they brought their kids so I had people to play with.


The beach and all of the other elements of the Ocean environment were absolutely super. A review of a map will show you that the beaches run in a East/West line and look directly into the Block Island Sound. With a prevalling wind from the Southeast the surf was always great and I very soon was a very good body surfer. About the only thing negative about the beach were the rip tides that could be very strong. But once you had a little experience and had survived you know how to handle your self if you got caught in a rip tide.


The beaches of Florida, especially those in the Panhandle area have beaches of wonderful fine sand but mostly just white to light yellow but the Beaches of the Watch Hill area are also very fine and much more beautiful because of the strands of granite and titanium sand that provided a true beautiful addition of color.


Even in 1939, the OH had some problems relative to the state of repair but who cared because you were on vacation and the most important events were related to people. The one physical attribute that I will always remember was the dinning room were the American Plan meals were served.


This room in its hay day was wide and long and occupied a space that ran the full length of the East side of the hotel. There was a main carpet covered aisle down the length of the room and the tables were set up to the right and left of this aisle. To get to your table you would usually enter through the main door and walk the aisle to your table greeting all the people you knew that might be there when you arrived. The more status you had the closer your table was to the ocean side tables and the farther you would have to walk. My Dad was in politics and he just love to work this room. For me, there was a back entrance that would allow me to get to our usual table quickly so I could get on with the serious business of eating. For a 98 lb little guy with a high metobolism, this was just great because the food was just wonderful especially Sunday evenings that was presented as a seafood buffet. The rest of the days you had a menu with maybe six choices. Yes, the food was good espcially the bakery products. There was also a house musical group that played during both lunch and dinner and then in the cocktail lounge after 8PM.


The other thing that you can not appreciate about the OH physical attributes were the porchs, the rocking chairs and the ping-pong table. But before I run out of time let me talk about the people who worked there that really made it all work.


When the Miller‚Äôs bought the property they had other properties in Florida. Some where in their back ground there had met a young Negro gentleman who taught English at a black college in North Carolina and he had worked for them in Florida and had become a very close friend. In 1939, that was definitely an unusal situation and one that should be praised from on High.


So, when the Millers bought this property with four floors and lots of rooms they needed help and turned to Doc. His marching orders were to find the best of the best student atheletes and bring them North to work for summers as Bellmen, Waiters and Maids. Doc did his job and thus began a very long tradition of the best help you could get at the OH. Doc was always the head Bellman. The guest loved the excellant service and the servants loved the good pay that they got both on an hourly pay roll and tips. I can remember overhearing heated discussions by guests asking to be assigned to specific waiters. Later in the fifties when I was getting ready to either go off to war (Korea) or college, Doc and I spent many late evening hours talking about the problems of the South and how they would eventually be resolved.


I worked at the OH as a beach boy and assistant life guard during the summer of 1949 & 1950. Myself and the Head Lifeguard lived in one of the four suites of the Cupola. It was a wonderful experience and if I had the talent would make for a great F. Scott Fitzgerald like tale.


I sincerely hope that the old girl makes it and that the gentleman with good intentions is sucessful. He has bought himself a wonderful piece of Real Estate and more importantly a wonderful piece of the History of New England.


I live in the South now, in the Atlanta area, so I don‚Äôt get to the North too much but if the OH opens this summer I will want to make a reservation to walk with my wonderful memories and to enjoy the beaches that have not changed.'

  content: 'Are there any updates as of April 2008? In so many ways reopening this station could be a boon to Pawtucket, Central Falls and so many people. More food for thought. (1) We are likely to see a major contraction of populations from the exurbs and outer suburbs back to the inner suburbs and cities, due to the housing bust, the resultant recession, and especially energy prices. To illustrate, a family that bought a McMansion in Burrillville or some such place, are paying to heat a flimsy 3000 sq ft house, and trying to commute to/from the sticks won‚Äôt be able to afford it; they will sell out and move closer (or into) a city. Pawtucket and CF are primed to swell as a result (IMO). A revived P/CF train station would be PERFECT for the economy and social health of both towns. (2) Preservation lovers, who are mostly true-blue liberals, are not going to like the resulting social impact: gentrification. Perhaps not an absolute spike (think, Boston‚Äôs South End) but significant. Central Falls could look completely different a decade after the train station reopens. Both cities should be prepared with low-income housing initiatives, etc. Providence has not (IMO again) gentrified in the same way that Boston has. What I saw in Boston was low-income, minority populations getting pushed out of inner-city neighborhoods like Jamaica Plain and winding up in newly ghettoized fringe cities like Brockton and Lowell. (3) It is worth this risk to see two wonderful cities become revitalized. Mayor, keep on pursuing this! Liberals, keep on supporting it! Crazy evangelical Christians (like me), let‚Äôs figure out how we can best pursue the good of the city we are in - its rich and poor alike!'

I was always crazy about trains, and watching the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford ‚Äì Amtrak‚Äôs predecessor ‚Äì was always a joy. First, there were steam engines, then diesel-drawn passenger trains.


The New Haven‚Äôs Boston locals would zip through the station, but a few would stop. Later, Budd card replaced the trains drawn by America Locomotive Co. (Alco) DL-109 engines.


I got a ticket to ride one day from Providence to Pawtucket, just to ride the train and take a few pictures. It turns out I got onto a Worcester-bound train (yes, passenger trains ran daily to the Bay State city then) but would not make a Pawtucket stop. It was only a four-minute ride, and when I told the conductor I needed to get off there, he was really irked and that‚Äôs putting it mildly. He pulled the train line communication cord, which set off a while in the engineer‚Äôs cab, to stop at the next station. The train made a rapid deceleration, I got off on the platform, and off they went. I suppose the lost between 30 seconds and a minute from their schedule.


The station was in decrepit condition then, although, I believe, tickets were still sold inside. That station, even tough it is mostly derelict now, CAN come back from the dead. I offer Worcester‚Äôs restored station as an example. In the 1970s, I happened upon the station and looked inside. It looked as bad if not even worse as Pawtucket‚Äôs station does today.

Our first attempt (2) failed because of the black spray paint not showing up against the red brick, but our second try (2.5) succeeded due to a white background. It was on a small outcropping where a door came out on the roof and visable, to our pleasure, from the highway. It lasted a couple weeks before whoever owns that building ripped off the entire part of the building that had the stencil. Damn shame!'

  content: 'Grew up in long shadow of South Street, father of good friend worked across Point Street at Manchester St. Generating Station. Recall well dark smoke issuing forth from stacks, including large black stack atop 1925 steam house.


South St. signifigant as you could see development of electric power generation over decades. Original plant topped by eight short stacks wedded by iron filligree work. Thirty two coal fired boilers fed high and low pressure turbines of about 25 Megawatts each.


Ca. 1926, large black stack west side of plant topped four steam generators feeding two high pressure turbines of forty megawatts apiece. ‚ÄúSmokestack Lightning‚Äù, as tall black iron riveted stack was dubbed, ceased smoking mid-1970‚Äôs, casualty of oil shocks.


1919 section of plant, east end, continued to roll hi and lo pressure turbines. Ca. 1955, steel ‚Äôn glass futuristic structure, northeast side of complex, containing two steam generators replaced remaining 32 coal fired boilers that fed short stacks. New 65 Megawatt hi pressure ‚Äútopping‚Äù turbine installed. Early concept of today‚Äôs cogeneration, new steam generators fed topping turbine, whose exhaust steam was in turn fed to existing hi and lo pressure turbines. This gave South St. its 110 Megawatt capacity from three generators.


South St. was base load station designed to run continuously, as turbines continued spinning up to three days following shut down. Starting was slow process, low pressure steam fed low pressure turbine whose electricity was fed to generator of hi pressure turbine, acting as a starting motor to get hi pressure turbine spooling up. Ingenious. Once high pressure was achieved, topping turbine was started.


About 1991 South St. decommissioned, west stack, long cold yet nonetheless dominating skyline, was taken down, classic lines and all.


1979 this writer toured South Street during summer heat. Generators screaming, boilers throbbing with hot gasses and flashing water, steam shooting at supersonic speed to turbine nirvana. 1982 visit hosted by Ed Reid. Screamingly silent South St.‚Äôs turbines dismantled for maintennance. Another visit 1985 thrilled small son and fiance.


Timeless powerful lines of plant an architectural treasure, good to know they‚Äôll be preserved by museum. Early autumn 1968, wee hours, awoke to thundering loud roar akin to turbojet afterburner. Sound of Boeing 707 taking off in our driveway. Scurry outside into cool fall night, southwest sky rendered in two by plume of white vapor shooting skyward.


South St. had ‚Äútripped off the line‚Äù, shutting down generator. To avoid catastrophic overspeed following disconnection of generator from turbine, valves slam shut, shunting supersonic thousand pound pressure, thousand degree steam away from turbine, thru mufflers, not so silently into atmosphere, source of most dramatic nocturnal thundering.


An architectural treasure whose slow evolution from 1919 forward still conceals fascinating mysteries. Switch panels of marble, control room partitions of copper, a bygone era still accessible through frosted glass framed by industrial black steel frames.'

Was not aware of any artist studios back then but I do remember the ground floor clothing store. The proprietors who appeared to be time travellers from a much earlier era were peculiar and seemed suspicious of RISD-type folk as customers. I remember the room as being quite dark with shelves stuffed with NOS clothing going up to the high ceilings. I bought a wide novelty pink necktie with a printed image of a ‚Äò40s/50s women‚Äôs face with a cat‚Äôs-eye sunglasses pin attached to the eye area and a pink and grey sport shirt that looked like something Elvis would have worn in his early career.

Our JAYCEE Chapter and Foundation have been for-ever advocates of mill restoration in the Pawtuxet Valley region, especially as it accesses the beautiful, picturesque riparian scenes and power of Rhode Island‚Äôs longest waterway, The Pawtuxet River.


The Ace Dye Building and the concomitant Royal Mills Building, provides a majestic appearance in the aggregate welcoming at a glace of real hydro-proportions for residents and visitors to the eastern-entrance of the Town of West Warwick.


The JAYCEES have been a principle presence to a sound and modern approach to ecological preservation and economic development with the support of mill rehabilitation projects, the construction of statewide bikepaths, open space heritage lot development as well as their own award-winning, JAYCEE Corridor &amp; Arboretum, that is the portal entrance to the state Senator Donald Roch Riverwalk; all which meanders at the confluence of the south and north branches of the Pawtuxet.


There are many dedicated people that have given enormous time, personal resources and even sacrificial commitments to maintain the historic architectural countenance and environmental enhancement of the Pawtuxet River Basin and Valley and the JAYCEES are certainly pleased and humbly proud to be a part of that.


Best Wishes and continued success to all.<br>

I  honestly believe that a forum such as this while providing historical data for a structure such as this, should also be able to provide a warning for potential tenants of this company. If you research recent activity on the property you would find that First National Development allowed almost 30 people and their pets to move into this building without any certificates of occupancy. They lied to many people to get them into the building as a way of staving off foreclosure, and subsequently put our lives in jeopardy. Fortunately no harm came to any of us that were living there, but practices such as this need to be public record, and they should honestly be run out of town.

  content: 'I think it was the summer of 1982 when I was a student in the film department at RISD that I first encountered the bridge. In those days you could still get into <a href="/property/east-side-train-tunnel/">the tunnel</a> that led from beside Thomas street, above <a href="/property/101-north-main-st/">The Blue Point restaurant</a> to near the area of the bridge. I used to drive my International Harvester Scout through that narrow tunnel on occasion. That was a great vehicle. It had the steering wheel on the right hand side since it was originally used for delivering mail. I could drive like a maniac and my front seat passenger, whoever was fool-hearty enough to drive with me, would always get the blame. One day, I just decided I would climb to the top of that bridge. It was long before the fire which damaged it badly, and it looked like some kind of giant ladder, perfect. I had a video camera with me to document the experience. It was a brand-new, early, state-of-the-art Panasonic ‚ÄúPorta-Pack.‚Äù This was a VHS unit that had a camera with a long cable attached to a separate recording deck you had to sling over your shoulder and carry along. It was bulky and cumbersome but it was incredible, and I felt like the luckiest person in the world to be able to actually use this kind of thing. It was a bright, sunny day, maybe a Sunday, as I climbed up holding the camera in one hand and navigating the ‚Äúrungs‚Äù/ties with the other. I narrated my thoughts simultaneously. The most striking thing I remember was the view. When I got to the top, I felt like I was the last person on earth for a moment or two. I sat up there for I don‚Äôt know how long, my feet dangling over the water, just watching the world and enjoying it immensely. I later showed the video in class and my teacher just about had a heart attack, some of my fellow students too, seriously. I didn‚Äôt get into trouble, but I never heard the end of it. I think the story may still be told within the hallowed halls of the department. Where is that tape?'

I remember him telling us about the Brown crew team that passed the mill every day on the Seekonk River. Reading the names Charles Reilly (son of Red Reilly? who also worked there) wrote about brings a flood of memories. Anyone remember Bob Clark and his Newfoundland dog Champ? Working at Washburn was dirty, hard work. Those guys earned their pay for sure. The strike in the 70s was one of the worst in RI. There were 5 kids in our family and I can remember my dad saying how some of the younger guys would follow the trucks that crossed the picket line all the way to New York. My dad stayed there when they settled the strike to when they closed. This dangerous, dirty, old mill and the men who proudly worked there are a thing of the past.

He worked there from about 1945 to about 1970. I worked in the mill for a couple of years, 1959-1960. My Dad was a ‚Äúcatcher‚Äù in rod mill #1 and I worked as a catcher in rod mill #2. I was one of the youngest to learn that trade. It payed very well relative to other manufacturing jobs in R.I. at the time. But working with the hot steel was dangerous. One of the foremans I worked for had a patch over one eye that he had lost by getting hit with hot steel rod. I can only remember his first name as Manny. My dad died about five years ago. He would have remembered far more names than I can. I remember Jack Finnegan of Cranston who was my dad‚Äôs foreman. I think my dad got his job through Dan Morrocco who had worked there before 1945. I can remember some of the guys nicknames. There was a fellow we called ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù because he always talked very loud like he was broadcasting on the radio. And I remember a fellow called Harry the Fisherman, because he liked fishing so much.


I am sure that if I search my memory and check with my mom who is 90 years old but still doing fine and has all her faculties, I may be able to come up with some more names.


In fact, I would like to do that, as I am a part time freelance writer, and I have been thinking of writing about steel making in America and what has become of it and to use my experience at Washburn Wire as a source.


If I were to become real ambitious, perhaps I could do a story on Washburn Wire and the people who once worked there, If I could find enough to form a story. Might be a good piece for RI Magazine or the Providence Journal.

My brother Frank also worked there for a short period of time. There is no doubt that the salaries were outstanding for the day. I also brought lunch (homemade) to Chuck on a regular basis. I was given a tour of the buildings approximately in 1977. It was like walking into a Charles Dickens novel. I immediately was overcome by the ominous feeling of impending danger, it could very well have been a premonition of the tour guide falling into a huge, square hole in the floor and breaking his leg. It was one of the filthiest surroundings I had and still to this day, ever encountered. I am also surprised that John O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs name has not been mentioned by anyone. John was the top union rep. I remember meeting Chuck at Asquino‚Äôs after the ‚Äúunion meeting‚Äù along with the other union stewards, Mike Chandly and Polland who‚Äôs first name I can not remember. Prior to the factory being purchased by OOS, while it was Washburn Wire, one of the most violent union strikes in the history of the State of Rhode Island was at that site. I have been living about 1/4 of a mile up river from OOS where the waterfront development is taking place. There are people living in the first set of condos completed, the housing area is called Ross Commons. The Narragansett Bay Commission which is located between OOS and my property have just completed millions of dollars worth of work which will now eliminate 96% of previous raw sewage overflow with a huge underground tank system. It is unfortunate that so many people lost such great paying jobs, but since the facility has been closed, the Seekonk River has cleaned up so much, it is amazing. We have blue-shell crabs, bluefish and stripers are so easy to catch. We have friends and family bringing young children here for a guaranteed ‚Äúfirst salt water fish catch‚Äù. The area now has Osprey, Snowy Egrets, Great Blue Heron, King Fisher along the standard swans and sea gulls living in the area from early spring until late fall. The selfish people who worked to close OOS down have contributed greatly to bringing the area back to what it originally was, an estuary. I have to say that it is really a pleasure to look down river and see the 1st of a seaside village rather than filthy, old decrepit broken down industrial buildings. The OOS facility was also the location for the filming of ‚ÄúOther Peoples‚Äôs Money‚Äù, staring Danny DeVito and Gregory Peck.'

Those pix sure brought back a flood of memories. The small white building way to the left of the long pix was where the maintenance shop and switch engine repair used to be. Working in the melt shop was the best and the worst. I loved to watch the heat get tapped and hear the molten steel plopping into the ladle. Burning sculls from the still glowing ladles was worst. Scull being the steel that splashed and hardened near the top of the ladles and had to be burned and muscled off with acetylene torches and huge pry bars. Froze our asses off in the winters and wore insulated underwear in summer to protect us from the heat. Damn few creature comforts in that mill.

Thinking of trying out the carpet warehouse ‚Äì is it still there? To walk to St Teresa‚Äôs, 4-5 of us girls from Hartford Ave Area cut through Paul Arpin‚Äôs, came out to a  Aleppo St  near the Mill and walked up the hill to Manton/Pope St. About a mile and faster than the school bus. Every day (except bad weather - then we took 2 buses) until I drove us to school.'

That summer, my mother and I went back. I can‚Äôt remember what we saw, but I know we had fun. That trip began the tradition of yours truly making runs to the snack bar (I‚Äôd advise against the burgers, but recommend the new soft serve stand), for dinner, popcorn, snacks. Of course, it‚Äôs pepsi, and I‚Äôm not a pepsi person, so we bring soda, candy, chips, etc. from home.

One of my mother‚Äôs sisters lived in the neighborhood (Water St.) that was razed to make way for Rt. 95 in the early Sixties. Her 3 decker apartment house was in the area of the present Apex parking lot. I went to Tolman High School in the early Seventies, and would walk down the street from the school to the store many a time. I bought many a record album there back then with money from my afterschool job at the Pawtucket Memorial Hospital. I also frequented the Newport Creamery. It was so convenient, the bus stop was right in front. Later, when I graduated from college, I bought many beautiful suits and other ‚Äúcareer clothes‚Äù there to wear to work, as well as jewelry‚Ä¶ The quality was great and the prices were very reasonable, I could afford to look great on a teacher‚Äôs salary. Nowadays, we have stores like Target which have eclipsed Apex, and try to occupy the same niche, but the style and quality just aren‚Äôt the same. As for Wal-Mart just forget it! To tell the truth, if I had the type of job where I had to dress up these days, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd go. It was a great store, I was sad to see it fade out from what it used to be. The building itself is a very distinctive landmark, let‚Äôs hope that it can be reused in a creative way if it doesn‚Äôt continue being a store. There are just too many blah buildings these days. And it stinks that stores these days think that they should demolish the buildings and put up another blah cookie cutter box. CVS, Walgreens, and WalMart are the worst offenders.


Sadly, these are the only types of businesses these days that have the money to buy huge properties like the Apex property. Case in point, the Apex building in Warwick, RI, similar to its Pawtucket sister building, was demolished a few years ago for a Lowe‚Äôs to go in. A lot of cities and towns see this as progress (and tax money for them) but it is a loss of cultural identity for the community.'

I worked for Bea Blistine and Ann D‚ÄôOnofrio in women‚Äôs sweaters, suits etc.  Most of all it was at the time of the mohair sweaters and they had just became popular. I remember two major happenings, first my register was more or less in the front end of the store, at the end of the night we counted our drawers, tallied and brought them downstairs to close out. I took a little longer one night as I had stock to put away but then it was time to go.  I looked around and suddenly noticed how quiet it had become and very little was on for lights. I stood frozen at my register listening for some sound, none came.


I was alone in Apex, no body was anywhere to be found and I was scared to death that I would set off an alarm and the police would come charging. After some time I looked out the front window and sometimes the workers went over to the lounge across the street, I stood straining my eyes until I saw a familiar buyer come out and I began banging on the window, finally he saw me and I was rescued.


Why did I not use the phone, I figured that had to be an alarm system. To this day I always make sure  I am well out of store when it says it is closing. I also worked at the store when the entire east coast endured the black out all the way to Florida.


Apex was a very nice store who always catered to their clients, I still frequent the store near the registry, not the same but some memories come back.

The new hospital will be at least 25% bigger and will support at least that much increase in patient throughput and impact on neighbors. They should have built a beautiful new hospital on North Main. Everyone I spoke to, including hospital planners and economists, volunteered this solution before I could suggest it. They didn‚Äôt, so we move on, hoping for a better relationship based on more responsible, neighborly behavior in future. So far, it‚Äôs been better than before the clash.

It seems we have all become so dumbed down with the visual restraints placed on us by commissions and commities. While the three tenaments have their rightful place in RI‚Äôs rich architectural history, vinyl siding should never be considered ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù. True character comes in the form of innovative, progressive, often daring ideas. With out innovative thinkers we wouldn‚Äôt have some of our most treasured Rhode Island architecture. Bye bye State House (Mckim, Mead &amp; White). The dome alone is amazing and was considered too radical for its time. We can no longer afford to reject modern buildings with innovative uses of resources. These building standards often incorporate LEED requirements and have minimal impact on the environment while adding another chapter in our history. I think we should continue to have a open mind when we look at Providence‚Äôs architecture and the rich visual story unfolding.


Think about it, no one gets hot and bothered by the Court Yard Marriott which ‚Äúblends‚Äù in and to some extent, fades away. Instead, your eye is drawn to the GTECH building which acts as a counterpoint to all of the other ‚Äúclassical‚Äù architecture. Without this balance one can‚Äôt truly appreciate different styles and gestures.

  content: 'As the Sales Director at The 903, I had received many requests for hardwood floors by potential buyers. We created stringent guidelines for those who chose to have floors installed. We also offer the installation of hardwoods as an upgrade option. To ensure diligence before approving hardwoods, we actually brought in a professional sound testing company to verify the sound levels were compliant to industry standards in the units below. Additionally, the condo docs require that 80% of any hard floor surface be covered with rugs. There is no issue whatsoever with the ‚Äúadded weight‚Äù, as noted by Shauna above (where did that come from?). Wood framing on a four story building is not a problem ‚Äì steel framing is required for high-rise structures, for the weight bearing requirements of many floors. Otherwise to typical three and four story multi-family house would require steel as well. And yes, there are steel beams in the construction ‚Äì the framing is wood. RI has some of the toughest fire codes in the country; we are fully compliant with all regulations. Since we are aa fully sprinklered property, I feel a lot safer here than in a typical single family home. As far as security and neighborhood, I encourage anyone with concerns to speak directly with our head of security. He is a 28-year veteran of the Providence Police Dept, and like me, he also lives here at The 903. There is onsite security staff as well as electronic surveillance at all entrances and exits. Also feel free to contact the Providence Police Dept to verify the safety of the property. The best advice I can offer anyone is see for yourself.

They said the wall board and beams are stronger than they need to be. I have never seen problems with doors or windows, and only minor cracks. The place is so warm that I often have the AC on in the winter. The units are quieter than any other apartment building I have lived in. People are so critical of the place, but they aren‚Äôt asking $500,000 per unit. It‚Äôs affordable, safe and passed inspection twice, the first time when it opened, and two years later when it went condo.'

Architectural criticism is more than talking about a building‚Äôs general appearance. Just like one doesn‚Äôt some up a person by the clothes they wear, a building is so much more than the way it looks and those opinions are so subjective. Some people like modern architecture, some people like historic architecture. Personally I think that they can coexist quite gracefully. The Europeans have mastered this. Why do Rhode Islanders seem to struggle with it so much? Someone from Europe would laugh at the way the mall looks because it looks like a cartoon or a weird Disney version of a New England skyline. If you think about it at one time Victorian architecture was radical, modern and strange to some. There seems to be an international architectual revolution going on, particularily in green building and the new modernism as seen in magazines like Dwell.The past is the past.

The Gtech location has the potential to make a great urban street with outdoor restaurants on the mall side and retail on the Gtech side. It could create a really nice extenstion of downtown leading to Waterplace park and the capital. It would also provide a nice sense of enclosure to waterplace park. (which the mall did a good job of when it was built but this will be even tighter) The designs that Ive seen for the Gtech building however are atrocious.

One sister asked a Sailor friend to take him on the stage for the Annual Children‚Äôs Beauty Contest. The sailor was, of course in his sailor suit, too. My brother won and his prize was a doll. (At that time he had long banana curls, with natural curly blond hair and blue eyes.)


And when others commented on him being a good looking girl, he would say, "NO, I AM A BOY!" Shortly after his win, my father insisted that he get a boy‚Äôs haircut. Perhaps the contest sponsors expected a girl to win, so had a doll waiting for the winner.


As a senior in High School, I was at the park with friends and saw one of my classmates betting on one number. But, she kept losing. It was my lucky number, 13. When she walked away, I put a dime on 13 and won. Some said I should give the prize to her since she was trying to get a suitcase. But hey‚Ä¶ my family wasn‚Äôt made of money, either, And I was very young. If it happened today, she would have had whatever she chose and I would have wished her well. At that time, I chose a lamp.


On weekends in the fifties, we roller skated, bowled, and danced in the Ballroom to the bands. Rock and roll ‚Äî the new music ‚Äî was just starting in ‚Äô56, and we needed to learn all about it. Elvis was on TV and from then on other singers could never compare to him after hearing him on Ed Sullivan. The Park with the grand ballroom was the best place around to meet friends old and new. And clambakes for annual outings for my father‚Äôs work, they were great, too. We lived in Fairhaven near the water, and seafood was the best and inexpensive. The best thing (besides the anticipation that kept building) when planning an outing at the Park ‚Äî was bringing picnic baskets and using the picnic area.

I remember on Sunday evenings after dinner watching The Lawrence Welk show and seeing the The Semonski Sisters. The Semonski sisters were a family musical act that appeared on television from 1975 to 1977. I received a signed photo of them and had my picture taken with them as well. I was only 9 years old and hold this memory in my heart as it was at a time when my family was a family still. I had so much fun as a kid and completely enjoyed eating the food while at the park. I knew once we went of the Fall River bridge that we were heading to Lincoln Park!  I remember that I hated when we went over the bridge I would get so scared and once we were over the bridge I continually looked out the window to try and see the park as we approached. In 1978, I moved across the street from Cresent park, which was also closed down and abandoned in 1979. I remember as a kid lets call it breaking into the park that was closed and going into the shore dinner hall and gathering up all the tickets from the game machines and with our friends in tow we would all pretend to be enjoying the park and playing as if we were a family visiting the park. What we think of later in life is amazing. To think that life back then was just so innocent and playful. Today living in Florida my family and I hold and have held annual passes to Disney World, Universal Studios, in orlando. We today attend these huge theme parks and have the time of our life. I hope that they remain around for a long time so that my child can take his children there and enjoy his family time and remenisss of enjoyable times with the family as a kid.

You have to drive around a bit, but its fairly easy to find portions of the fences that are torn down so you can get in. Some entrances are very wooded. There is a fence around the roller coaster, because its literally falling apart. If you go around there are paths leading to small things like rundown concession stands, the outer structure of what once was a carousel, a tilt-o-wheel platform, and lots of colorful/somewhat obnoxious graffiti. There are ways to walk right into the fence guarding the roller coaster, but they are built up or dangerous. The entrance to the coaster says ‚ÄúEnter the vagina of hell.‚Äù Its understandable since accidents and fires have occurred here. I tried to cross over the lower tracks of the coaster, but this was a bad idea; the floor board I stepped on fell in.

The Water St. boys would go and cruise around the dance floor, checking out the babes, getting our groove on. Bands from the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs would come and entertain us. Sometimes there were fist fights with rivals from Fall River and other places. We were ‚ÄúGreasers‚Äù. Those were the days!'

  content: 'I grew up visiting Lincoln Park in the 70s and 80s. I will always remember traveling up Rt. 6 from Wareham and looking out the window to see the giant ‚Äúseahorse‚Äù and know that it only meant one thing... We were going to Lincoln Park! When my little league baseball team won the championship, in stead of going to Disenyland, we went to Lincoln Park. When my cousins would visit from out of state, we went to Lincoln Park. It has been a part of my Summertime fun since the second grade. My Dad also remembers going to see ‚ÄúChief J Strongbo‚Äù wrestle at the park when he was growing up. My last memory of the park was in the Summer of 86 with a girl I was dating only to realize that it was the first time I had been to the park without my parents present. NERD!


Then in the Mid-90s I moved to Holyoke and discovered another great amusement park that had also closed in the late 80s. ‚ÄúMountain Park‚Äù started out as a trolley park and evolved into an amusement park just like Lincoln Park. Both carousels were made by the same company. In looking at the pictures of the park and its many differnet rides I noticed the same identical pastel colored structures located in both monster rides. I investigated furtehr online to discover that the same artist worked for both parks and the owners were the same too. The MT. Park carousel had also been relocated to Holyoke‚Äôs Heritage Park which is located across from Holyoke‚Äôs Police Department. A pavillion and a walk over structure for the Mini-Golf area are the only things left standing from the multiple fires that also plagued Mountian Park. The simalarities of the two parks are uncanny to say the least. I also learned that most of Mt. Park was still standing in 95 when I moved up, but did not discover the park until most of it had burned down.  When I was younger and we would visit family in Holyoke, we would always travel to Riverside Park which is now Six Flags New England. At that time Mt. Park was deemed unsafe due to the bus loads of New York residents that would attend the park on weekends. Then I discovered that I had attended Mt. Park when I was younger. My Mom gave me a photograph me riding on the carousel with her when I was only 12 months old. I will end with the fact that Lincoln Park was the only park for me!'

The sound of the roller coaster and the kids screaming, cotton candy stuck to your fingers, candy apples, soda and popcorn, lost in the fun house, kiddie train, monster ride and cooling off on the merry go round while dad waved at us.

Once a year my mother would take us kids (if we were good), and we would spend the whole day just running around like crazy people. When I was old enough to work, I got a job working in the concession stands when minimum wage was something like $3.65 an hour. Fried dough, candy apples, cotton candy, and clam cakes, I sold them all. Sometimes my German Shepard, Mickey, would sneak in through the back gait (we lived on Reed Road) which got me into trouble a time or two. He was just following his nose to the great smells though, he didn‚Äôt mean any harm. On my day off I would often go to just hang out and ride my favorites like the Comet, the Whip, or the Bumper Cars, but I loved all the rides.  Quite a few romances blossomed there, too, those were the days.  Nearly thirty years later, I still have vivid dreams of that coaster ‚Äì Six Flags, Disney, and Universal don‚Äôt hold a candle to that crickety wooden track. I‚Äôll never forget that treachorous plunge that made you come right out of your seat! After the park closed, I worked on weekends at the Flea Market selling things for my landlady in the old ballroom, but it just wasn‚Äôt the same. Once the rides were auctioned off and they vandalized what was left on the deserted grounds, it became difficult to even drive by any more to visit my mother. But Lincoln Park will live on forever in my heart and in my memory, as I‚Äôm sure it will for thousands of others who enjoyed it as much as I did.'

As a child of the 60‚Äôs-70‚Äôs, my parents would load the four of us kids into the station wagon, sometimes with a couple of extra friends for our annual summer pilgrimage from the Cape to Lincoln Park. We wore our hand stamps like diamonds, and jumped from ride to ride like chipmunks on mochachino. Hands down, without a doubt, the Comet ruled! My cousin Steve Hill, God rests his soul, was one of the last of the famed roller-coaster operators, and the stories he would tell... Before his day, there was the old guy with the wooden leg. Did anyone have the brass to ask him how he lost it? Of course us kids assumed it went without saying was an obvious  occupational hazard that any man would eventually incur if they stood on that grey platform hoisting the little ones from the carts on a hot August day, then pulling the large wooden levers that would start the carts rolling into a sea of adrenaline. I can still remember the day that I finally measured up to the height chart for entry, almost as a right of passage to teen-hood. Surely anyone who could survive the Comet, would walk their path on earth from that day on, a little taller, a lot braver. Clam Cakes, Popcorn and Cotton Candy was the breakfast of champions for park goers. And in the 70s, everything was groovy, and Lincoln Park was the epicenter of cool. The funhouse was like walking into a different dimension, and a view from atop the Ferris Wheel provided a view like looking into a field of neon and human ants. My first bona-fide addiction was to Skee Ball, where we would typically end our day. And the drive home, always quiet. Driving past the park as we left, hoping to return again one day. Maybe with our own families, to pass down the tradition that was handed to us, on a sticky, red-and white striped paper cone. All that is left now is fading memories, and nostalgic photos of great times past, with family and friends, at the greatest place in the world.'

Probably a group of about twenty including my VaVoa who enjoyed just sitting by the rollercoaster and people watching. As a teen, Friday nites were spent at Lincoln Park with friends. My uncle, Roland Barros, worked the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù rollercoaster ‚Äì which made me and my friends feel like we were important!! Favorite rides were the Paratrooper where you got a good view of everyone else(boys!) at the park and the Monster Ride. We used to jump out of our carts and wander through the ride! I never went on the Comet! It was forbidden by my parents as ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù. By the time I was old enough to go without them ‚Äì I was too chicken! Something I will always regret... On Saturdays we would go roller skating. My mother used to make me and my friends our skating outfits and matching pom-poms for our skates. My boyfriend and I use to love to go on the Ferris Wheel at nite.(Except for the time some drunken fool in a car above us tipped his beer on us!) The last time I went there was their last season. I took my then two year old niece. I have wonderful pictures of the day we spent there. Especially of her riding Mother Goose ‚Äì a favorite book of hers at the time. What a wonderful place it was... Although I and others are filled with sadness when we drive by and see what remains of our beloved park, I hope the families of all the owners of Lincoln Park realize what a great heritage they have ‚Äì their families brought so much joy and happiness to so many people for so many wonderful years.'

He always laugh when we descended and I begged him never to do that again because my brother Billy, would start to shake the cart and I would scream to Heaven to get me down. But that guy always spotted me and would stop it at the top, Like the Freddie Cannon Song, ‚ÄúStop at the top of the Ferris Wheel‚Äù. But for me it was a nighmare being only 10 or so. But I never gave up a chance to ride on that Ferris Wheel. I liked the games they had there, I would please please plese Mar give me a nickel I know the number the wheel is going to stop on. My Mother always said, the only time we will get a red light is when we are driving home, a red light on the wheel meant you got a Ham. Wow, we always were hoping for Mom to win that ham, she did and we were the happiest kids around. Such great memories, so many moments in my heart and mind to say this was the carefree era.

As a man in his 40‚Äôs I recall countless great times at the park... particully the coaster and to be  now standing there in front of what was left of this amazing ride yesterday was kind of heartbreaking. The same rider boarding station I would run back up to reride the coaster for the 30th time as a child that day now stood before me colapsed‚Ä¶ though much of the ride is intact compared to the rest of the park. As I walked the grounds, I was trying to recall the proximity of the rides to the coaster‚Ä¶ I believe the bumper cars were nearby as well as the full house of mirrors. The flying chairs ride I beleive was at the other end of the park. Of course now it all being over grown it is hard to tell where everything was situated. A few concession stands remain and I think a horror house too‚Ä¶ a bit charred out etc‚Ä¶ as I do not recall the four devastating fires that took down much of the park in the 90s. Kind of eerie, ghostly and mostly sad to witness what was such a vibrant park to now appear to be something from a sci fi movie set.

We were from Rhode Island, and we usually went to Rocky Point (also, sadly, demolished and about to become condos), but a trip to Lincoln Park was a huge event because the rides seemed much more exciting. Almac‚Äôs grocery store gave away free tickets for the rides according to how much you bought, so when my mother accumulated enough she would load up the car with neighborhood kids and we would all go. I was very little at the time. My older sister and her friends were thrilled with the massive roller coaster, but I was frightened even looking at it, so I never did ride on it. Everything seemed oversize. spent most of my time in Kiddieland. It is part of the family mythology that once my mother ‚Äúlost‚Äù me in Lincoln Park, and she and the other kids looked everywhere for me. They found me some time later riding on the Turtle, where I had happily been for most of the day. I wish that it was still open so I could have brought my children and now my grandchildren. The huge amusement parks that are so popular now seem like overkill, and running through the park with a gang of your friends is like a memory from a dream.'

When I was 18 I got a job at the park working in the paint shop with Dominic Spadola and Dave Comstock. We painted the rides, signs and anything else that needed attention. We spent one winter remodeling the Lounge into a Disco club complete with lighted dance floor. I also ran rides for Manny Correira and and worked some of the game stands for Slim McConnell. My favorite ride to operate was the Tilt-A-Whirl. It was located behind the Bubble Bounce and next to the Paratrooper. Before the park opened, all ride operators had to perform a routine maintenance check on their rides. It was after one of these checks that I went over to the Bubble Bounce to say hi to Bob Rayno who had ran that ride for many years. He was retiring and that was going to be his last day at the park. As I walked toward the Bubble Bounce I saw Bob laying on the ground. I checked to see if he was alright but he didn‚Äôt respond. I ran to the office to get help but it was too late. Bob had suffered a heart attack and later that day I found out that he had died. In the early 1980‚Äôs I was in a band called Sanctuary with park employee Dave Comstock. We played in the Pavillion and often rehearsed in the Bowling Alley which by that time had become an arcade. I continued to work at the park until 1985. I met many people who have become life-long friends. I have fond memories of my time there. It was such a great place that I often went there even if I wasn‚Äôt working.

When i got home i was on the internet 24/7 trying to learn as much as i can about it. Last night, i was on the internet and i found out that  a guy wants to put in 252 condo units. So i went to the Ellen degeneres  website and signed up and for ‚ÄúMY LIST‚Äù so i said that i would like lincon park to reopen. And i wrote a desription. I will post what i sadi at the end of this mesage. anyways, i also contacted the mayor of darmouth and fall river and i still havent heard back from  them yet. lastly Whoopi Goldbeg often come to my home town Gloucester MA, and you probally know how she is into fundraising.

**The One and Only Thing That Should Change:**
The Only thing I ever wanted was Lincoln Park in Fall River MA to re-opened. Lincoln park was an amusement park that everyone has loved for decades.  Last year i was driving to my grandmothers house with my dad and we were driving down the old main route, route 6 and i noticed this ‚Äúroller  coaster‚Äù and i was like DAD TURN AROUND! And he said what? And i said i saw a roller coaster and he said oh yah that was the old amusement park  i used to go when i was a kid. And i was like well, why is it closed? And he said that it closed in the late 1987‚Äôs and I wanted to re search  more about it. Well, when i got home to my home in Gloucester Massachusetts I started researching about it and i found out that it was a amusement park  opened in the early 1890‚Äôs and i thought, well, this is an historical site! So i have been researching more on trying to find out how we can save  this park. And i found out that it was for sale and someone had bought it and wants to get rid of all of the remanding stuff that is still standing,  such as the roller coaster, some food buildings and other rides. This roller coaster named the commet was the fastest, longest, most enjoyable roller  coaster in the world until I think the 19050‚Äôs. The guy had bought it wants to put in 252 condominium units. Which actually breaks my heart (Even thought i have never been to it.) that someone would want to get rid of the historical stuff. I would like you to help get it up and running or even start a fundraiser to get it back in business. I would love to be able to see it running cause this amusement park was a part of people‚Äôs lives. I was reading that a couple had gone to the park in the 50‚Äôs and when on the ferries wheele and had there first kiss. Which I think is very cute, but that is kind of topic. But what i really mean is that i want to stop this person from putting up 252 condo units and get the park back in business. If you go to google and type in Lincoln Park Fall River it should come up with lots of options to see pictures of what it looked like and how it looks now. Or go to www.defunctnewengland.com and on the left it will have a sidebar and scroll down and click Lincoln  Park and it will have lots of choices to see pictures. The guy who wants to build this condo-land is going to pull down the roller coaster with five  trucks, which i think is completely absurd. But this park means a lot to  me and again i know i have never been to it, but this place was a fun, colorful,  amazing, joyful, and had a ton of excitement. This park is a part history. So I would love to start a fundraiser and actually raise 2.5- 3 million  dollars to buy it from the company before it‚Äôs to late. I wish i can become more and become a better part of this community. I really appreciate  who ever reads this and i would love to see the smile on peoples faces and see them happy again.'

  content: 'I grew up down the road from Lincoln Park, although the year my family moved to Westport was the year that the park officially closed for business. My very first memory, which is a foggy, 5 year old memory, is of a small semi enclosed rink, similar to that of bumper cars, where riders would sit on these little wheeled platforms with handles. I may be crazy, but if you know  of these, please let me know.


I remember the fires ‚Äì‚Äì the second of which was the worst, with thick black smoke and ash that dropped like snow from  the sky. We would walk down and stand in the median on Rt 6 and just watch in amazement. Most of the amazement came from the fact that the roller coaster never burnt down. When I was in high school we would walk down, slip through  the fence and walk around, just marveling at what was left. There were some  old light bulbs, fragments of wooden, colored banners, and you could make out the spots where all the rides had once been.

Secondly, it was further from home than most of us had ever been. I remember at least 5 trips there, 2 with St. Mark‚Äôs in Dorchester and 2 with the Murphy Day Camp also in Dorchester. Those four trips were somewhere between 1976 (First Grade) and 1980 (Summer between 5th and 6th Grade). My last trip there was with my parents and some friends from New Bedford in either the summer of 1982 or 1983.


A few photos are of the former train shed that went around the minature golf course. It was a little diesel engine that pulled a few cars with the engineer sitting on the top of the engine and everyone moving along at 10 MPH.


It is sad to see Lincoln Park go. You could always tell who were the up and coming redneck rock groups were by the t-shirts worn by the operators of the rides. With all these parks gone where will I get a Saga or REO Speedwagon mirror now?'

  content: 'Never walked this tunnel as I live far away but have done others. What a rich story of urban adventures since its demise of RR use. As a historian and rail expert who at night runs the oldest regional performing arts incubator in part as another urban renewal effort but with enrichment and inclusion by colleges in Philadelphia, I can appreciate all of this.


But not having this tunnel used by RRs has greatly hurt downtown Providence and your regions economic performance cutting out maybe 1/3 of its potential feeder rail network which in other cities has proven to be the key for long term vitality as much as colleges and other better known factors. However a new old day comes again and otherwise what would be another half a billion dollars to build tunnel is positioned right where it is needed again for rails if you are to have a better future and Providence is to actually stay on the Next Generation 200+ Northeast Corridor line being planned which I am advising. Before Amtrak and other entities came to the same conclusion they shouldn‚Äôt cut out Providence for this additional new line for the 21st Century as was originally being planned and still advocated by many powerful interests, I was looking at how to get a new High Speed train line to your downtown but to avoid the series of severe Pawtucket curves which are not near any, all-trains stop station like Providence. Your closest in curves including East Providence and its draw bridge to a modified underground downtown station via an attractive and even scenic new high tech single post slow double track viaduct with low (so riders can still see your attractive downtown!) wheel sound barriers and baffling over the river, streets and lower parking lots would all not be to much of a speed restricting problem for new trains that will reach well over 200mph elsewhere. Existing MBTA and any freight trains would continue on the existing line north till it again turns to sharply into the straight old line right of way to be rebuilt at that father out point where high speeds are required. Any Amtrak trains could still use the existing NEC line too if needed for critical back up if nothing dumb like to expensive and incompatible all new maglev is planned to be built for the next generations as every other country on the planet has decided in favor of evolving high speed trains (tested at 357mph by the way). Maybe more initially obvious to those who have not studied these things for as long as I have, your RR tunnel is needed to have any rail services due east of Providence too as modified local trains that would be required to share the medium speed tracks in the tunnel with slowing High Speed trains can take the place of many Light and regional rail proposals in that direction. The other old trolley tunnel could also be used for any trolleys to the top of the hill and closer in to East Providence perhaps too as I design these things for communities but would need to look closer at that then I have scouring the East Coast for solutions and best designs for the Next Gen NEC.


Providence needs to see and advocate for all this for itself or it will likely miss out on the benefits or RI would have to contribute to something much more expensive and disruptive to build rather then retrofit. NIMBYs and others who are against any change or still think we only subsidies transit travel in this country need to be shown how this is the best solutions. Any who doubt something much faster is coming to the NEC should understand that the two initial High Speed lines built in the world by the Japanesse and later the French after studying our line in the 1950s are most like the NEC demographically and otherwise mostly both made their total costs back (planning, building, equipment, operation and ongoing in-kind replacement shares) back within 10 years of opening even faster then I had realized due to the lines being used to finance thousands of other miles of more! Key politicians on both sides of the political divide who are supporting the Next Gen HS NEC are now learning this fact which has been vetted by a major Midwest University study for another lesser corridor there.'

We walked all the way to the Union Station (at that time, on Kennedy Plaza, not below the State Capitol where the present station stands) and startled the train customers as we strolled nonchalantly through the lobby.


The Science Library at Brown sits directly over the tunnel at the corner of Thayer and Waterman Streets. In the 1970s, freight trains still operated in the tunnel. If you were in the library at the proper time, you could feel subterranean rumbling. Several times I raced by elevator to the top floor of the library and caught the Seekonk bridge in the horizontal position, further proof that a train was using the tunnel, though I was never lucky enough to actually SEE a train crossing the Seekonk River.


I continued in graduate school at Brown, but by 1980 I no longer used the library and am unable to comment on which year the trains stopped using the tunnel. I am certain they operated at least through 1980. On my first post-graduation visit to Providence in 1989, the viaduct that carried the tracks over Main Street from the west tunnel portal to Union Station had been dismantled, but the tunnel portal had not yet been sealed off with the steel doors.'

One of our big dares was walking it alone! In the late 1960‚Äôs it was a place to hang out at times, mostly on the Gano St. side. In The whole area around the tunnel was a playground for us as kids. There were ponds on both sides of the Seekonk that we use to skate on, catch turtles, etc. and generally hang out. We use to hop on the trains going through and ride to either downtown or across to East Providence. I remember we use to lay pennies on the tracks so the trains would flatten them. And the big thing when we were older was, we use to climb the train bridge when it was up. That was cool. We use to call it the Black Bridge.'

A homeless guy was encountered inside the entrance a ways, standing over a little campfire but he didn‚Äôt give us any grief. The wind howling thru the tunnel made it way colder and once we hit the middle where the tunnel turns left we were plunged into darkness. Couldn‚Äôt see either lights at the end of the tunnel. Naturally we didn‚Äôt bring flashlights and the effect was creepy to say the least. Not my idea of a pleasant experience but it did elevate the senses. It felt like you were caving under a mountain and all you could hear were bats and the endless drip, drip, drip. As we headed for the East entrance, light was seen again and although no one said anything I think we were a little relieved. Tough guys, eh? One scary feature were the icicles hanging from the tunnel ceiling. These suckers were easily 8-10 feet long and my imagination got the best of me. I was constantly shifting my line to prevent from walking directly beneath any of them. That bit of fun now over, we spilled out into the open East side where the old rusted hulk of a train bridge headed out over the river. We stopped to huddle for a minute, wishing we had some beer to celebrate the historic crossing. Then realizing we needed to return, we turned and plunged back in.

One newsmaking event involved RISD students having some kind of year-end party ritual that was like the aforementioned LaSalle one, only that it was far more ‚Äúartsy‚Äù and tribal in nature ‚Äì kind of like a proto Rave party ‚Äî it involved drums, torches, bonfires, running naked (in some cases) and chanting and overall boisterousness. Police were called in for what was called in about as a ‚ÄúSatanic ritual‚Äù (hardly) and a near riot occurred when they shut it down, lots of people hauled in including bystanders on Benefit, one of whom was apparently injured, mistaken for a reveler. That was about the time they decided to board it up as I recall.

It was an amazingly cathartic experience and when we emerged from the tunnel on the east side we all felt like we had somehow been reborn.


We took several trips through the tunnel in the year that followed. Once we brought torches, but, while fun, it definitely lessened the experience. Plunging oneself into total darkness in an uncertain landscape frightened us, and made our other senses more alive.


On one of the trips, we were confronted by a huge guy and his disfigured little friend, who were in the process of finishing off a case of Bud cans by the bridge on the east side. We didn‚Äôt even notice them off to the side of the tracks until the big one said ‚ÄúHey!

By the time we got there, the only things that were left from the castle were the copper beech tree (there were some other, newer trees, but we are guessing that Olmstead picked out the beech), the massive stone gates and the hedge. We designed the house around the beech tree.


There is also a massive concrete piling right at the corner of the Shaw Avenue and Narragansett Bay escarpments (which is not actually part of the lot that I purchased). I was told that that was one of the footing for Dutee Flint‚Äôs transmission tower ‚Äì it was certainly big enough.

My wife‚Äôs grandfather was Alexander MacBeth and maybe my grandfather was there also, He was Torhild Johnson. Now MacBeth was on the cover of National Geographic as Silversmith and hanging on my hall wall is a copper head of Lincoln 10 x 8 that was produced at Gorham after hours by my grandfather Johnson so the family story goes. The other couple had a relative and I will send that name later. Now that I am touching base with this, I remember that the Johnson name was related to the statues in Roger Williams Park. and it just came to me that my wife has a small charm of a pitcher that was made from a dime. These are good examples of silversmiths that loved their work and it appears that they spent time on memory items. It is too bad that the factories of the past are just memories. '

We used to cross the Jamestown Bridge to catch the ferry to Newport Naval Hospital. The Newport Bridge was just under construction at that time, the towers were just being erected. Since I had grown up in Throgg‚Äôs Neck in the Bronx (NY) I had the rare privelege of seeing that being built, a sight which I partook of every single day! I would compare the Newport Bridge Construction with the Throggs Neck, and sort of ‚Äúanticipated‚Äù what was to come next, being quite taken by the difference of proportion for each structure. Some of the other Seabees and I had the opportunity to cross the Jamestown Bridge early in the morning hours (I think it was in 1965). The road was desolate, and we had the chance to talk to the toll collector about the bridge. This good natured man patiently accepted our humor in his inimitable New England Way. He then ‚Äúlocked our jaws‚Äù when he told us the story about the hurricane in the ‚Äô40s where the bridge swayed so much that they ‚Ä¶‚Äúthought they were going to lose it‚Äù.


I have been building bridges for the last 40 years with Consulting Engineers and Contractors and the anecdotes written by the others on this page have touched my heart. I give great credit to the imaginative engineers, designers and detailers who turned raw steel into the beautiful structures such as the Jamestown and other bridges which capture our hearts and minds, and I am in awe of the research scientist / engineers who have developed the techniques we use today which have rendered the beautiful ‚Äúriveted filigrees of steel‚Äù in our old bridges their rightful, respected place in history.

Later, for the rare ‚Äúlong trips‚Äù to Rocky Point (anything off Aquidneck Island is considered a ‚Äútrip‚Äù) once I started driving in the late 80‚Äôs, I remember the white knuckles at the top, praying traffic wouldn‚Äôt stop. The one time traffic did stop, we were (of course) at the top and everyone was practically holding their breath. Even without the grates, the steep incline (which in memory is probably more steep than it really was) was scarey enough. By the early 90‚Äôs I was used to it and it was just narrow (like driving on East Main Road). Sure, the grates made you uneasy, but after you had a few trips under your belt it got easier. I almost forgot about the grates. That was until I got my motorcycle license and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù about the grates until I was already on the bridge. Of course it was rush hour, and following cars showed no mercy. All the way up I was worried about how slippery it would be and if I would drop the bike and ‚Äúcheese grate‚Äù myself. It wasn‚Äôt until I was on the grates (now going at about 5mph not caring about the cars behind me) that it was a view straight down as if nothing was under you. That was the closest I ever came to literally almost wetting myself. I went back through Providence that day and never went over on the motorcycle again.'

You got used to it though. I lived on Jamestown for 4 years. It was a beautiful bridge (wonderful to walk over at night). My dad had a 38ft Pacemaker boat when I was a little girl and it was a huge deal for a kid to be out on deck when we went under the bridge and look up and see the cars driving over the bridge through the grate in the middle. We always wondered if the cars would fall through on us. It would give me the willies. Anyway. I‚Äôll sure miss that bridge. You weren‚Äôt a real Rhode Islander unless you could drive over that high narrow wiggly Jamestown bridge like it was nothing.'

As we were crossing, a truck approached from the opposite direction, and even in my tiny  Beetle we had to pull over till the tires were almost scraping the curb  on the right. Feeling the wind make the bridge sway was certainly an  experience, too.

My mother, Italian through and through, loved her Chinese food. She once told me that when she was pregnant with me,she would go downtown and in the course of a day eat at 3 different Chinese restaurants. Luke‚Äôs must have been her favorite though because she never took me anywhere else.

I remember the Luau Hut but always thought it was for ‚Äúadults‚Äù. After a day of shopping on a Sat. we would stop at Fanny Farmer‚Äôs (still the best chocolate I‚Äôve ever had) and get a box of ‚ÄúBordeaus‚Äù to bring home. Usually, we would also grab a bag of hard candies from Kresege‚Äôs. Shopping on a Sat. downtown was _de rigeur_. Everyone did it. The stores were great and full of great items.

Toy Sun‚Äôs, Thayer St. Next to Avon. Sort of nice and more expensive than the other 2. Went there a lot with future wife.


Brown Jug, Thayer St across from Quads. Lots of "Brownies" on stools at the counter. Big "American" menu.


Brown Bear, Brook St. up the road a bit from Loui‚Äôs [Once a fellow grad student took me for some ‚Äúreal‚Äù Chinese food, which he ordered, in Chinese, by going back to the kitchen and talking to the cooks. One of the best ever.'

Lots of gay people went there and we always felt comfortable and welcome. The Ming Garden was more upscale than Luke‚Äôs. It was more expensive but the linens and furniture were more modern and elegant. It was special to eat upstairs. I can remember going there with my friends and they all ordered their food "no MSG".

My father approved of Mee Hong as opposed to some of the other Chinese restaurants in RI (ie, Hon Hongs, Luke‚Äôs, etc.) because he was of the belief that Mee Hong did not use pork in its Chop Suey or Chow Mein (basically the only two items most of us were allowed to order). So, my entire family would go there on special occasions for Sunday dinners, always accompanied by bread, butter, and ‚ÄúCole Slaw, Peas or Beets?‚Äù (this was the oft-repeated refrain of every waiter in the place). And my mother and I frequented the restaurant for Saturday luncheons before shopping downtown. I became totally turned off to Chop Suey AND Chow Mein (who knew the difference) after an episode of having been given a Chop Suey (or Chow Mein) sandwich. I have never been able to eat soggy bread ‚Äì and that was the soggiest bread I had ever eaten. The rest of my family, however, loved the soggy sandwiches. Two bites of the sandwich and I spent the rest of the afternoon ‚Äì well, I don‚Äôt want to go into the details, but you may feel free to use your imagination. That was the end of Chinese food eating for me, but not the end of Chinese restaurants. I came to adore Mee Hong‚Äôs batter fried fish and chips ‚Äì also served with bread, butter and ‚ÄúCole Slaw, Peas or Beets‚Äù (I always got the cole slaw). The fish was nearly tripled in size after having been batter dipped and deep fried and I couldn‚Äôt get enough of it (actually I could never finish it). I was chastised both by my father, and an Aunt who also took me to Mee Hong on occasion, for eating a non-Chinese dish in a Chinese restaurant. Fast foward about ten years, and in Washington, DC a date wanted to take me out for Chinese food. I could only remember Chop Suey and Chow Mein and wanted to decline. I was convinced to give it a try and was delighted to learn about the glories of chinese spare ribs, shrimp toast, mu shu chicken (never pork!), and some szchuan and hunan delights. I became a fan, once again, of Chinese cuisine. But I am very sad to learn, upon returning to my native State of RI, that Mee Hong, Hon Hong, Port Arthur, Luke‚Äôs and Ming Garden have disappeared from the tapestry of downtown Providence.'

  content: 'My father went to work for J & H Electric Co. part-time in 1919, while still in high school, and, after learning his trade as an armature winder and electrician, he retired from the company 47 years later as shop foreman. As a youth, I spent many hours keeping him company when he worked overtime on nights and weekends rewinding motors, some of which were over 200 HP in size.


The basement of the building was where the old wire coils were stripped out of motors prior to installing new ones, and this area also contained a large in ground varnish tank in which newly rewound motors were dipped and sealed with a special type of varnish, in order to protect the coils and insulation, then baked in a large oven to cure the varnish. The oven was also used to bake the moisture out of motors that had been underwater in floods, etc. The first floor contained the reception counter, the large motor department, a machine shop, locker room, and the loading dock/shipping department. The second floor housed the buisness offices, stock room, and the belt and drive department. On the third floor small motors and power tools were repaired, and it also housed the coil making department ,which produced custom-made. replacement coils for the large motor repair department. Specialized electical control panels of various types were also designed and built by J & H.


The company was frequently called upon to service electic motors aboard many of the ships that came into the port of Providence. They also took care of motors and related equipment in many local jewelry manufacturing sites. Much of that work was done on an annual basis during the 4th of July week, when many factories closed for vacation. The company also did commercial wiring.


I remember my Dad telling me how, during the 1938 hurricane, he left the building just in time to get out of the downtown area before it was flooded. Several fellow workers, who stayed around to talk after quitting time, found themselves stranded and their cars under water.


It was nice to learn that the building is soon to be put to new use, now that it no longer is the home of J & H Electric Co.'

Novelties stocked on shelves up to the high ceilings in no discernible order. But old man Morris always knew exactly where everything was, from spider rings to Chinese finger traps. Rumor was, there was a back room where were certain off-limits movies could be sampled, but I was just a kid and never confirmed this. Across the street was a large meat packing operation and the Blarney Stone bar, where in future years my friend Henry and I sometimes sampled a draft Guinness (rare in RI back then). It adjoined the Triple Diamond social club... to us a mysterious association with some Irish connection. Interestingly, other than negotiating craftily on pricing for a grand gross of live boxed chameleons (for real), the only thing I remember about old man Morris was his anger at the fire department. He hated firefighters with an obsessive passion, and could go on for a long time about how often they water-damaged his goods and axed his doors for no good reason. Ironic that the place eventually succumbed to fire.'

Clients would come in and order (and prepay) for kegs of full strength beer (‚Äúnear‚Äù beer was allowed to be made), which was made at the former Hand brewery. Lavell also ran a speakeasy down the street at 24-28 Fountain St, which boasted the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs longest bar‚Äù, which eventually became the more familiar Doorley‚Äôs. The site is now a parking lot. Lavell, who was arrested and convicted of federal tax evasion in 1931, went on to re-name the brewery the Rhode Island Brewing Company and operated it until his death in 1939. I am also told that the basement extends under the sidewalk. I am unsure of what has happened to the little building since the 30s; I would hope that if the adjacent parking lots are developed, that the building is incorporated into the new structures.'

I‚Äôm glad East Providence saved it from being torn down or sold.


Does anyone remember Emancipation Day, August 1, of each year? Someone mentioned rock and roll concerts. I seem to think I saw Dionne Warwick there at the beginning of her career in 1962. On Thursday evenings, there would be dances at the Alhambra Ballroom. You could tell when there was a break in the music at the Ballroom because these couples in ballroom attire would stroll up the midway. They looked out of place among the more casual attire of the other parkgoers.


By the time the Alhambra Ballroom burned in 1969, it had been turned into the Sugarberry Lounge. My father knew the chief of police for East Providence. He told us a story about the police chief. He said the police were frequent visitors to the Sugarberry Lounge to break up fights, etc. One night, the police chief was present as several teenage boys were brought out of the Lounge by other police officers. When one teenager emerged, the police chief hit him across the face. One of the other officers said, ‚ÄúWhat did you do that for?‚Äù The chief said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my son!‚Äù'

That animatronic fat lady and her whooping laugh just creeped me out. But the building always intrigued me. The Showboat, on the other hand, was a different story. One day I worked up the nerve to go inside, and boy, was it weird. It was like a lysergic nightmare. And I‚Äôll never forget that strange chanting sound all the way through the ride ‚Äì unless I imagined it!'

  content: 'Yes, I do recall the Laff In The Dark ride. It was my first dark ride, at age three in 1957, and I‚Äôve been in love with them ever since. Laff In The Dark was a 1935 installation by the former Pretzel Amusement Ride Company. The ride was originally called Pretzel and a for a few years renamed Witch Cave. In 1950, the facade received a major face lift by park painter Len Minor and it was renamed Laff In The Dark. New stunts were purchased to supplement the original Pretzel figures. It closed after the 1963 season and the building became part of the park‚Äôs new Wild West walk-through fun house, aka ‚ÄúHotel.‚Äù More info can be found here: <a href="//laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelogic/crescentpretzel.htm">laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelogic/crescentpretzel.htm</a> and <a href="//laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelride/pretzelride1.htm">laffinthedark.com/articles/pretzelride/pretzelride1.htm</a>'

So what identifies a ‚Äôheyday‚Äô in Crescent Park terms? I was born in 1950, and my favorite years at the Park were 1956-1966. What wood was used to build the Riverboat/Showboat ride? I recall the Ride standing and operating with the big roller coaster still running behind it. I was IN the ride at the ‚ÄôSwamp‚Äô turn when the coaster cars went flying by behind the building. Yes, you could hear them!


Does anyone remember the Laff In The Dark ride? There were the usual light-up stunts all the way along, but the cars jerked into and out of the turns. The set-up crew knew exactly how to lay out the track so the cars would just miss each other. Now THAT was scary! I saw the track with a pocket flashlight (cheating) and found that the first few turn degrees were removed and put on the end of each turn. No WONDER the cars jerked!


By the way, the condos were built on the old parking lot. They don‚Äôt extend into the midway. Crescent Park would be alive today if management had promoted ‚ÄôThe Park FIRST‚Äò like it should have. Long live Crescent Park!'

I grew up in East Providence in the 1940s and Crescent Park was such a big adventure for my family. Planning for weeks only heightened the desire to finally get there, to ride the wonderful Looff carousel and to reach for that brass ring. It was always a family event that took up the whole day and night. I still think that the best clamcakes and chowder ever was served there. My parents and the older folks settled into the Shore Dinner Hall for a day of eating and imbibing of good old Narragansett Beer which was served in quart bottles which somehow never got empty. then it was chowder, steamers, lobster, corn which seemed to go on and on. The children got to explore the Midway with all of it‚Äôs games of chance and promises of great treasures to bring home and enjoy forever. We felt so grown up in the Dodge em Cars as we spun around and enjoyed the fun. The Fun House was both fun and scary to all of us and we stuck very close together until we got to the mirrors and laughed and laughed at how strange we looked. Too soon it was getting dark and the music was starting up as we watched young and old alike dance and twirl around the Alahambra ballroom. And then it was time to go home. Oh what grand days they were‚Ä¶ Thanks for the memories.'

There was the radio stand, gift stand, cigarette stand, stuffed animal stand. I also ran the hoopla stand where people tried to throw wooden hoops over prizes mounted on block of wood. I ran the ski-ball stand and got pretty good at that game. We had a dime mounted on a piece of wire that we used to give free games.


I remember each summer Emancipation Day when all the blacks would come down from Providence and get rowdy. We white middle class suburbanites were always on edge because occasionally there would be fights and violence. The police in those days had a lot of leeway to handle troublemakers. They had long wooden clubs, blackjacks and a vicious devise called the iron claw.


There was this girl we called ‚ÄúAngie the pump‚Äù who would provide sexual favors behind the Alhambra Ballroom. Once I remember the ambulance coming to get some guy who had a heart attack doing Angie behind the dance hall.

My wife and i freqently visit it with our two boys.

I remember alternating trips to Rocky Point & Crescent ‚Äì a few times per month during the summers of the 1960s and early 1970s. Personally, I favored Crescent Park ‚Äì there was a magical aura of slowly driving down Bullocks Point Avenue and seeing the luminated ‚ÄúFlying Fish‚Äù lit sign grow larger and larger as we approached the park. Fondly remember playing ‚ÄúDixieland‚Äù and ‚ÄúMoulon Rouge‚Äù pinball machines in the arcade. Afterwards, taking a turn on the Dodgems across the way. Loved the comical wall mural on the back wall. Next, would take a ride on the ‚ÄúBubble-Bounce‚Äù. And, of course, the favorite attraction was the ‚ÄúShowboat‚Äù dark ride. Still remember the animated musicians rocking and rolling, and, the kinda scary pirate who would go round and round on the top floor. Lastly, took some nudging from friends to finally take a liking to the western-themed walk-thru fun house across from the Showboat. Think as a little kid, the animated large laughing lady in the front entrance window scared me!! To this day, we still go back to the park to ride the great Looff carousel. At times, I will walk to the back of the attraction and peer down the stretch of grassy land and imagine what once was a magical midway!!'

Does anybody else remember "The Warehouse"? I seem to recall or at least think it was somehow associated with, or to, one of RI‚Äôs first early, big music/rock promoters: Skip Chernov (sp?). Maybe the old "Warehouse" ended being knocked down and then all the other stuff then developed over time‚Äôs course. Any older parents (or even grandparents) the others of you can maybe casually ask if they‚Äôd ever been to the Warehouse ‚Äì over 40 years ago? I also went to the Bootlegger and Shooters off and on on very rare occasions later, just to see how much it‚Äôd changed from what I remembered from my 20s.

It was opened by Carmine D‚ÄôElena, Joe Cirelli and Dr. Ken Silvestri. My management team was brought up from Ft Lauderdale and included Bar Manager, Jamie Welch; a bartender/trainer named Bart, a waiter/trainer, named Tony Landells and the General Manager, whose name I can‚Äôt recall, who later became an attorney. (He was from Buffalo, was crazy and a great guy). Later the Izzo family of Metals Recycling in Johnston bought it and Jack Walrond became the General Manager. (I think he owns a restaurant on Main Street in East Greenwich now). Doug Palmieri, formally of WHJY, was my barback, as was Johnny from the Newport band, ‚ÄúThose Guys‚Äù.  I can say without question that working there was the most fun I ever had. On opening night, I worked with a girl named Beth at a portable bar on the roof. (Beth was... well let‚Äôs just say very well put together, which is why we made $350 each that night just serving canned beer and wine in plastic cups. (Man, I think my finger nails almost feel off from reaching in that ice water and opening those pop tops all night.) Over the five years or so that I worked there, I saw soooo many amazing things. For example, when the night ended we would go up to the roof and watch, ‚ÄúFriday Night at the Fights‚Äù. It was amazing how many people I saw get knocked out cold. The best body contests at the pool bar on Saturday afternoons were a blast. Then when they decided to put a roof on the top level and make it a dance club, we could work year round. <br><br>
Now that I am in my early forties and drive by the building, it makes me sad and makes me smile at the same time. I think about the over 200 bartenders and 400 cocktail waitresses I worked with in that 5 plus years and wonder what happened to everyone? How did it fail?  We would ring over $19,000-$20,000 at the Pub bar in one night ... in freaking 1990?????! Think about that? How much did we have to serve to ring those numbers every night when an Absolute was $3.75? Frozen mudslides with Bailey‚Äôs, Kahlua and Vodka and Ice (no cream) were $5.00. Heineken was $3.00 and Bud was $2.00. How did that place fail?????? That was just one bar. We had three more on the top floor and also had the pool bar, which was always just as busy as the pub?????!!!!!!!!! That place was soooo much fun!!!!!!!!! I hope it comes back.'

Two model units were constructed and many units were presold, but when the stock market crashed in October, 1987, the financing could not be consummated. Cerilli obtained a franchise from Shooter‚Äôs and built the club at great speed and cost because of time limits in the franchise agreement.

(Oh ‚Äì as a side note it is In, not near, Hopkinton which is one of the towns that make up Washington County. It is near The center of Hope Valley which is a village in Hopkinton) (**A.I.R.**: Fixed in the description).


I worked there as my first job ‚Äì at 15 years old. I worked for the then owners Mr Hurley and Mr Jones. I was ‚ÄúThe Farmer‚Äù ‚Äì the job to have. The Farmer was responsible for all the daily maintenance of the park, kitchen and rides and care of the animals in the petting zoo as well as giving each ride worker thier lunch break ‚Äì the ‚Äúfixit‚Äù guy. I worked there from around 1984 till the end of 86 when I got into a big arguement with Mr Hurley over the care of the animals and walked out, apparently using a little bit more than a capfull of detergent to clean the animals barn floor cost too much. Went back about two weeks later when asked to come fix the main bearing on the scrambler by the manager (she was a family friend ‚Äì and how I got the job).


Mr Jones and Mr Hurley sold the park to a couple of guys that ran a go cart track out on the Cape. That is when the park began to go to pieces ‚Äì they just wouldn‚Äôt spend any money at all on anything (even worse than Mr Hurley) and I left permanently after that. Took my kids there around 2002, and it was a far cry from what it had been.


When I worked there they had the Roller Coaster, the Ferris Wheel, the Mary Go Round, the Scrambler, the Octopus, the little battery powered bumper cars (not the remnents of those in one of the pictures), and a small little boat ride thing down near the shoe. Oh, and of course the very annoying kiddie music that blared throughout the park every day over and over and over.'

To agree with Anne, to a small child... it was amazing. There is a picture of me in the petting zoo area near a cow at 3 years old, the cow was sniffing my head... for years later, I thought that was why I had a cowlick in my hair :)'

The ‚Äúshoe‚Äù with a slide, the little school house, etc. It was a nice setting for very small kids, but not much to do beyond running in and out of the buildings and pay a quarter for a handful of pellets to feed the goats in the pen. The last time we went, they‚Äôd put in that little roller coaster. It didn‚Äôt look very safe, so we passed on that one. They had a small go-cart track, and one of those boat rides that go in a circle in a litle bit of water. Kids rang the boat bells until the head explodes. Sorry the park is gone, but then I was crushed when Crescent Park and Lincoln Park closed. I loved places like that.'

Say what you will about peeling paint and food poisoning, but to a 2-7 year old kid it was a fantasy world of unlimited rides and little lines. Once the place closed we spent way more on pay as you go rides closer to home than we ever did on an outing to enchanted forest. There have been rides there as long as I can remember but the last company did add quite a few more of the cheesy kid rides (that kids happen to like). There was a tilt-a-wirl and I kind of remember this ride that would whip you around the turn in a large oval.'

The Enchanted Forest had many fun rides, such as the Ferris wheel, the swing-out merry go-round, a Tilt-a-Whirl, etc. Around 2001 I worked there and it was nothing even close to the same. Rockwell Amusements took it over and basically ran it into the ground. I remember working the coaster one day and as it went up the hill, it caught on the chain and fell back down the hill injuring a couple of people. The owner of the park told me to tell them to leave if they had a problem. They also imported boring rides such as helicopters, some fish thing that went in a circle and a train without enough horsepower to go around the track. You would have to go and push it around the track; and this was for $8 an hour at a summer job. The gokarts would spark and the Titanic slide they bought collapsed on numerous occasions. Word of mouth killed that place. Also the animals were terribly mistreated and there were food poisoning outbreaks from the kitchen. All in all I would say may the Enchanted Forest rest in peace; finally.'

In a misplaced zeal to save energy during the crisis in the seventies some consultant simply CUT the control wiring.

Friends parents that used to work there say there are hundreds of unmarked graves around the property. Paitents were raped, gave birth, and the workers killed and disposed of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù i guess you could say. The dentist is a whole other story. Because these kids were mentally diabled they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt feel pain‚Äù, so the dentist would just pull out teeth, an do all sorts of things with out medications. Its located in the basement of the hospital, and every time i go in that part of the building i swear i feel a sort of pain all over. The showers they were given if you could even call it that was just getting sprayed with a hose, one with enoughpressure to break your skin wide open. Ladd has underground tunnels that led to all the buildings, and one that led to a creamatorim. Like Nazi style they would burn the ‚Äúuseless‚Äù paitents. Its not on any map of the grounds, and none of the workers really new where it was. But i found it in the middle of the woods riding on my atv. Its just a big cement block with two chimneys.

We found an opening in one of the boarded windows and thus made our entrance. However, my boyfriend at the time got a bad feeling and asked me to wait outside with him while our friends explored the dark corridors.


They were gone for awhile and all I can recall is hearing someone scream. They all came running out soon after and claimed to have heard something dragging on the floor above them and a low moaning sound.

If you just listen you will hear noises but use your head and you will realize that the building has a lot of leaks where water falls, and that its falling appart. Now having said that we left that building and climed in the second floor of anouther buildin, again we heard and saw nothing.After we looked around that building we left. But I do things theres something there because another time I was there with the same two friends and one more who wouldent get out of the car, and I swear to you we saw something none of us or any smart person we know could answer. Their were very long and skinny clouds reall low to the ground, they were moving alot faster than a normal clound and definatly was not from a plane...none flew over head.

  content: 'On January 24, 2006 my friends and I returned to Ladd School but this time not just to drive by it. This time we went inside the building. We went in through the basement window and started to travel through the main building. When we were proceeding to the second floor, a non-living person pass through my physical being and it was as cold as ice. I paniced for a moment unable to move or breathe then I was able to let out a scream to my friends who were about to turn the corner on the second floor landing and I told them what happend to me. They thought I was crazy so I kept the errie feelings that I was experiencing at the moment. Then just at the point of reaching the second floor landing we noticed that one of our friends was not near us. Just then we heard sobbing coming from the second floor. We went down there and saw our friend standing against the wall crying. We tried to get some answers as what happened to him and he was non-responsive to our request for him to speak to him for the first five minutes. After the duration of five minutes he seemed uncertain or baffled as to what was happening around him. Then after a few minutes as if coming out of a comastasis stage and having a flash back of a traumatic event he started to mumble what was going on and what he had seen. He could only tell us that he had seen a little girl in the building who was bleeding all over. I needed to see for myself what he had seen so I had him point out the room of in which he had seen the little girl. In the far right corner of the room there was a little girl roughly around the age of 7 sitting in a small chair holding a teddy bear with no eyes. Blood was pouring down her head and body. The way I hear it, this girl was not only murdered but also raped in this building and the story was covered up. When we saw this she pointed to my friend, told him to get out, not in threatning manner but I would say in a warning tone of voice because she knew we were in danger. When they saw it we ran for the basement window where we had entered the building. Upon exiting the building, my brother and I were the last ones standing in the basement when him and I heard something move in back of us. We both turned to see what it was and there was a tall, dark, and slender figure in back of us. The figure pointed at my brother and motioned to him as if it wanted my brother to follow. My brother turned around and climbed out of the window. The figure then turned to me and motioned to me as to follow it. I wanted to follow my first instinct and feed my curiosity but instead followed my brother and friends out of the window and back to the car. When we were driving away my breathing was not fogging the windows but instead frosting them with visible ice. I asked everyone else if they were able to see their breath and the rest of them said no. For most of the ride I was non-responsive to everyone but instead tried to focus on what or who passed through me. What is odd is that instead of seeing what I was trying to find, a picture of a woman in her mid-thirties clouded my every thought. I do not know who she was but the image of her face would not leave me. Then we stopped at a restaraunt and I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. In the reflection was a man who looked exactly like me but he had red hair and blue eyes and it looked as if he was trying to say something to me but I could not make out what he was saying. Now that my friends and I have went in there together, another trip to Ladd School is being planned but this time our main objective is to find the morgue. And here is a word of advice to those who plan on going to Ladd School, Bring more than just 7 people and make sure you don‚Äôt get seperated from your group because there have been people who went in and never came out and I‚Äôm sure no one has heard their story because they got seperated from the group. However I have had the honor of having some of my friends who were a part of those groups who were able to give the story of those people who have disappeared. May they rest in peace and our journey to discover the paranormals continue safely. '

  content: 'Like alot of the testimoniales you have who individually wrote to your site, They to were scared out of the building late one night in Nov.- Nov. 27th., 2005. One of which I know well. The "boys" FOUND - on the property jugs of a clear liquid substance, not knowing what it was and looking like ‚Äúalcahole‚Äù jugs, broke one while in the building on themselves. Two boys who were severley injured!


They entered in a window already opened on the third floor. THEY WERE SCARED HALF OUT OF THIER MINDS WHEN THE JUG BROKE, AND NEVER EXITED THE BUILDING WITH THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE DIED IF THEY DIDN‚ÄôT GET OUT, AND ALMOST DIDN‚ÄôT. COULD NOT FIND AN EXIT, ONE KICKED OUT A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AND WHILE THIS " SUFIRIC ACID WAS MELTING OFF THIER SKIN, THE BOYS COULDN‚ÄôT GET THIER CLOTHES OFF FAST ENOUGH.


Knowing the grounds and building to which I am reffering you must know how long they had to run to the road to even drive to the ER to get help. This was property of the State of Rhode Island and if the boys drank it thinking it was bootleg whiskey, which is what it looked like, we would be looking at the death of 2 to 6 children!


THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF VANDLES AND 5 CHILDREN WERE THERE BEFORE, WHO WRITE TO YOU OFTEN!!! TWO BOYS NEVER WENT. THAT WAS THIER FIRST AND LAST I AM SURE THEY WILL EVER SET FOOT IN THAT PLACE AGAIN AFTER BEING LED BY GHOSTS TO WHERE THIS WAS LOCATED, AND THEN IN PANIC AND SHEER TERROR BROKE A BOTTLE SPLASHING THEM, 2 SEVERLY AND ALMOST LOOSING THIER LIMBS COULD NOT FIND AN EXIT. THIS STUFF IS OIL BASED, AND DOES NOT STOP BURNING WHOLES CLEAR THROUGH TISSUE AND BONE AND DOES NOT COME OFF. EATS THROUGH MEDAL AND ANY SUBSANCE ON EARTH. JUST IMAGINE A WHOLE GALLON BRAKING, SPLASHING ON THEM WHILE THEY WERE ALREADY IN A PANIC TO GET OUT. THINKING IT IS ALCAHOLE OR WATER, THEN BURNING AS THEY TORE OFF THIER CLOTHES IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, NARROWLY EXCAPEING BY THE VERY SKIN OF THIER BODY‚ÄôS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW YOU KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WAS NOT DONE ON PURPOSE. THE POLICE WERE GIVEN THE LOCATION BY THE CHILREN THEMSELVES. SO THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD GET HURT, NAMELY YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS. SOME DAY I HOPE YOU TALK TO THEM SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE REAL FACTS OF WHAT WENT ON AT THAT PERTICULAR BUILDING ON THE LADD SCHOOL GROUNDS. MOST OF RI RES. DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW MANY BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS ARE LOCATED AT THE "LADD SCHOOL" GROUNDS. JUST THE GHOST STORIES FROM EVERY CHILD WHO WENT IN AND THIS VERY SAME THING COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM.'

Me and a lot of the other students that lived there with me would always sneek off campus and go to the ladd school, the fogerty buildin,g because it was directly next to our dorm rooms. Anyway one night, kenny M, myself, Rob M, Makayla M, and Tyler who was a really interested in this kind of stuff was so excited, Josh and Ashley whom are kids who believe in spirits and ghosts were getting really antsy. We were on the third floor and my necklace broke off my neck and my cross was broken in half. kenny freaked out and rob bugged out, we left and went back to our dormitory and told some people what happened but they didnt believe it, bu ti will tell you it is the last time i ever went in there. and ive been in the buildings over 10 times, sometimes more then once a day. i think the only reason that that stuff happened to me was because i preyed before going in and everyone else didnt but tyler told me ill have something following me for the rest of my life. its really freaky.'

One of my friends (who‚Äôs name I will not mention) had already been on the inside of the Ladd institution and was talking to me about her experience in there. All of my life I have wanted to have a super natural experience with the dead. We did ot go in, however as we were driving by, instead of feeling scared, I felt the presense of a non-living person in the same car as me. I do have to admit it did freak me out a little, but what I felt with me was not that of an angry spirit but instead a scared person. At the time these thoughts were passing through my head I heard a voice saying to me ‚Äúplease help me. I‚Äôm in the basement, please help me‚Äù. Yes I did pick up on some bad ora with that building but I believe that there are some spirits looking for resolution to what happened to them in that building. Do I plan on returning to the building? Absolutely, and I plan on going on the inside to do some further investigating on the matter to see what happened in the basement.'

We parked the cars a little down the road and walked a dirt road surrounded by the dark woods and old ladd buildings. we passed one old brick buidling which i believe is called Greene. we passed the next building which was Doyle and then we came upon the large orange and tan building. We went through the window and there was an upside down trash can waiting for us. we all got in and we walked around the basement for a little while. we walked up about 3 floors and searched everyone of them. nothin really happend but as we passed the morgue one of my friends said shut up shut up i hear something. so we all went silent and went up to him. the wall outside of the morgue was thumping like a faint hearbeat. i was taping the whole entire thing and throughout the whole night my screen would flip upside down and would get messed up. it happend about 20 times. we left the fogarty building and headed back to the car. i was leading the way with one of my other friends and we heard leaves crinkiling as if someone were runnign in them. my other friend saw someone running through the woods in what looked like a white hoodie. we left right after that. the next day i called a few of my friends to go back up. this time i only went with a group of five. as we approached the fogarty (big orange building) one of the rooms on the second floor lit up. We hesitated to go in now and waited. About 5 minutes later another room on another floor lit up. Once again we waited. Now a blue light appeared from the 4th floor window and from there it jumped around the building. It looked like it was being shined from the outside and after about 10 minutes it stopped completely. We waited a few more minutes and than went into the building once again. We went through the same window and walked right to the stairs. we heard a gust of wind, but no one had felt any breeze at all. we kept walking up the stairs and my older brother said he heard footsteps. We stood on the the floor which we had not been to yet, dead silent. all of a sudden i heard footsteps coming from an upstiars room. we all looked at each other scared and left for the night.'

  content: 'I was with one other friend, Eric and I‚Äôve heard a bunch of stories about the Ladd school. It was on November 20, 2005 when we went to find it. Our goal was to find it and nothing more. We had a dinky digital camera on us when we pulled up to, what seemed like the main building. It was rounded and eriee looking. As we pulled up to the buildings a feeling of slight terror over came us, but we continued to drive to the buildings. Until we reached what seemed like the far corner of the rounded building. I took several shots of the landscape on which the buildings lied upon. We pulled away from the buildings and somehow we decided to go back. to take a few more shots. We were at the corner once agian about 20 feet away from the rounded building. I rolled down the window to take clearer shots. I heard knocking noises coming from the forest behind us. I told Eric as he drove slowly to the side of the building to slow down so he could listen to the noises I heard a few seconds earlier. He convinced himself it was the car. He turned the car off so we could hear clearer. My window was down half way and he heard the noises as soon as the engine was off. The noises we noticed seemed like the were getting closer until they reached the building. then it sounded as if they were right behind the car. Eric was at the stage of full terror and I also panicked. Our car could not start for about thirty seconds. The sound we heard could be compared to a broom stick hitting a hollow tree. The pictures we took were very dark. But some did show some things that we could not explain. One picture of a tree facing the rounded building had a big white mark almost in the center of the tree. One other picture of the biulding had a swirl in it at the bottom left of the picture. We took a total of about 30 pictures and about a 3rd had little white marks in them. Eric is convinced thet it is his camera, but I bielive there was some type of energy lingering around the front entrance of the building. One- We felt frightened for no reason and Two- The strange noise we heard and the pictures could be some type of sign. I plan on entering Ladd School but I advise people who do try to go there, to go there with more then three people. I had some strange vibes about the place as we were pulling up to it. By the way the time was around 11:30 at night. This was my first visit to Ladd School. '

I can‚Äôt picture it, seeing as she had a mentally retarded daughter who was also in state care. I was just there in the beginning of November of 2005. I took pictures and didn‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary. In all honesty I was hoping I did. I would really hate to see it knocked down even though it may deserve to be. Its quite a historical site, and besides ,y mother, the only thing I have left of my grandmother. I would love to visit Ladd at night, the only thing stopping me is that I have a family of my own now and dont want to be arrested for tresspassing, or anything else for that matter. But I would like to tell all those who are brave enough to visit Ladd at night, to have some fun for me. Thanks.'

We did not get very far in when the digital camera my friend was taking pictures on shut off at full battery life. When we left, we walked about 200 yards and the camera turned back on at full life again. In two of the pictures there are orbs. The same group of us also tried to go back in the hospital building last night. We were walking up to the same entrace as on halloween and we were about 30 feet away when we heard a door slam and what I thought was shattering glass but the rest of my group said was a clattering chain. We ran behind one of the other buildings and decided not to try to go in this night. We thought if we went in we would either be in there with security or another group of people, or something else which did not appeal to us at the time. We plan to go back within a day or two though.'

We took a half hour drive up there. Absolutly no street light around, nothing at all. We parked across the street so we can walk to the metal gate we had to go around. We walked up to the gate and 3 of my started to b**** out. So we started to walk back to the car and we all said ‚ÄúBe quiet, lets see if we hear anything‚Äù. Once we became quiet we heard a loud moan coming from the woods. We ran across the street into the car. Then we drove up to the gate and shined our head lights down the road. That road was like 1/2 a mile long, pitch black. I wanted to go but my one of my girl friends wouldnt go so i stayed in the car with her. We parked the car facing the road just incase something happened. So she sat in the drivers seat and i sat in the passenger seat. We watched them walk down the long road with their flashlights. While i was watching them go down the road, i seen a strange orange some kind of flashlight looking at them go down the road. I looked like someone was holding it, and then it went off. A couple of minutes later it did it again. So i was freaked out, i called my friend and told them to come back. They said they‚Äôll be back in a minute. Then they just disappered around one of the windy roads. We couldnt see them no more. I was pitch black and all I had was my cell phone to keep the inside of the car lite. I turned around to see if they were coming and i swear i seen a white face in the back window and disappered. i thought it was a car light but no cars were riding by. I ducked down in the seat scared shitless. Then we were quiet and we heard someone or something running in the woods. We called them back and we heard them running. They came running back up to the car and jumped in and we drove away. They said they were hearing screaming coming out of the woods and they said they seen footsteps on the road and then they disappeared. We also saw someone walkin in the woods with a white hoody on and then it looked at them, thats when they started to run. But my friends went back again hallween night and they said that everything was knocked down. There was no more building left there. But you know that it was haunted by not even going into the place. Some scary s*** when its real.'

And when we never expected that we would experience the scariest night of all of our lives‚Ä¶ Before we even entered the building two or three people from our group said they saw a large shadow run throw the bushes ahead of the main enterence, when we first entered the building we went threw a large door that brought us into what seemed to be a kitchen area we walked around for a bit going into the rooms then went upstairs and went down a long hallway at this point there hadnt been any ‚Äúghostly expeirences‚Äù as we walked down the hall we passed the morgue when we went in there the first time all the draws were closed as we exited one of the people in our group fell threw the floor‚Ä¶ after that happened alot of crazy sh*t started. when we went by the morgue again to exit the hall every draw in the wall was open and there was what appeared to be body bags on each table that came out of the wall. at that point we began to move much faster as we were exiting the hall way we heard a loud sceram then sounded like it came from a young girl. It was the most horrorfying sound ive ever heard this scream sounded like a scream of terrible pain and tourment. as we were now trying to find our way out of the building as quickly as possible everything got cold the air was soo cold we could see our breath at that point the red metal holders for the fire extinguishers began to rattle and shake. The section of the ladd School that we were in was the large round orange building we could not find the exit it was almost as if it fanished we kept goin in circles trying to find our wat out and couldnt not find the way we came in it was at that point that my brother who also was terrified smashed a window with his hand so we could climb out but there was a piece of ply wood blocking the window after searching every room for a window that wasnt boared up we finally found a room that had two windows wide opened with a trash barrel upside down under it. It was as if they opened the windows to let us out. This is an Intierly truthful story chances our i will never return the the lass school unless its during the day!'

I have painted on memos, x-rays and have made some journals out of linen collected. Of course, none of which i have ever shown at gallery‚Äôs or sold because of it being illegal.

It started as a School for the Mentally Handicapped, but through state intervention, and a lack of insane assylums, it was soon filled to overflowing with the Mentally Handicapped, Drunks, Obsessive Compulsives, the Criminaly Insane, people who had had nervous breakdowns. It was quite a mix. I‚Äôve been to the Ladd School at least 10 times and each time is a little different. The padded cages on the first floor of the infirmary were used as some sort of punishment. My mother says that most of the insane residents would need to be sedated, restrained, and kept in solitary confinement. The strange looking chairs throughout the building are ‚ÄúShock Chairs‚Äù as shock treatment was largely in practice back then. It‚Äôs definately haunted though. I‚Äôve seen shadows run acoss the fields, when nobody is in front of a light source. My friend had his camera slapped out of his hand and was then pushed/thrown back 5 or 6ft while he was taking a picture. We‚Äôve videotaped some of our ‚ÄúExplorations‚Äù into the buildings, and upon watching the tapes, you can see strange orbs of light. Some people say it could be dust, magnified by camera, but we‚Äôve had these things checked out, and people have said they haven‚Äôt seen anything like it. The Rhode Island Ghost Hunters have thier own show on the Sci-Fi Channel, and the guys who run it live about 5 minutes down the road from me in Warwick Neck.

Why did they have cages in the school building? If you went downstairs, the first door on the right had cages in it. While we were in the hospital building, we were slowly making our way to the third floor when we witnessed what looked like a small fire?! And finally and definately not least, around one or two in the morning we witnessed a lady jogging around the place. She came within fifteen feet of us as we hid behind a wall. This is very scary stuff and I can NOT stress this enough... all of this is the truth!! Ask people about the underground tunnels, they ran from building to building. I will NEVER go back there. '

  content: 'People are calling this building a ‚Äútrolley barn.‚Äù but it was much more than just a storage building for streetcars. Until the late 1930s this building and its grounds comprised the primary repair shops (called Cranston Repair Shops) for the Rhode Island Company, the electric railway company that operated over 400 miles of electric railway tracks in Rhode Island until just after WW I.


At its height, besides the Providence, Pawtucket and Woonsocket local lines, the RI Co opperated the following suburban streetcar lines: Woonsocket to Pascoag, a high-speed line to Providence from Woonsocket and slow speed (i.e., side of the road) line to Pawtucket; a high-speed line from Providence to Warwick neck, Rocky Point and Buttonwoods; a long line to Narragansett Pier and Wakefield via East Greenwich (Seaview RR); the long line to Rockland and on to Danielson, Connecticut; and lines to Artic and on to Hope and Washington via Crompton.


In the early 1920s RICo reorganized as United Electric Railways and operated the streetcars in RI until the last streetcar line was abandoned in 1948. During the 1920s and 30s UER abandoned most of the suburban/interurban trolley lines except for a handfull of Providence local lines and the North Main Street line to Pawtucket.


In the late 1930s UER had cut back so much that they no longer needed such a large shop complex. So they vacated their Cranston repair shops and did what heavy repairs needed at their Broad Street carhouse, Elmwood carhouse and the Prairie Avenue carhouse. They sold the shops building and land in the back to the brewery which then used it as a storage warehouse.


I believe that the Elmwood carhouse still exists as does the Cranston Street carhouse and the Academy Avenue carhouse. There might be another one or two of the old RICo carhouses still extant.

There used to be tunnels that lead to the brewery across the street. This was so they could send the beer on conveyor belts to be loaded on horse drawn carts ‚Äì many many years ago, and not be seen because, according to my dad, The Internal Revenue Service granted the brewery a permit to brew, bottle and sell beer and malt liquor for medicinal purposes during Prohibition. The beer had to be sold on the brewery‚Äôs premises. Sales could be in a quantity of one gallon at a time and a prescription was required. So, they would bring the beer under ground and load it onto ‚Äúice trucks‚Äù to be delivered, illegally, else where.'

I am an avid researcher of historical facts, and the one thing that bothers me is that more people do not regard history as a foundation of our present but they regard history more as just a stepping stone to bigger and ‚Äúbetter‚Äù things. While I will admit that an electric mixer makes whipping potatoes a lot easier, I still enjoy using and old fashioned crank drive mixer my grandmother use to use. Why must we destroy the Mom and Pop corner store so that mass retailers like Walmart and Stop and Shop can build over sized, intimidating gargantuan buildings which just take up more and more open space. The site of the Main building of the Narragansett Brewery (Lets not forget that at one time there was also a race track where car manufacturers would bring their newest models and race for bragging rights.) which now houses a shopping center with Stop and Shop and Kmart as the anchor stores, could have had so much more to offer. How about a museum of work and culture similar to that in the northern part of the state which could have paid homage to those who made the Narragansett Brewery an icon for Rhode Island, which could have been the central focal point of a new state park with athletic facilities and walking tracks. But the almighty dollar and the dollar signs in the eyes of J. Paolino take precedent. I realize that I may be rambling on but my dismay and distaste for people who have no regard for history and feel that we should shun the past and only support a future which cuts all ties to our past gets the best of me. I hope that we do not someday have to once again learn how to build a world from soil and trees, rather I would prefer to learn how those that did before us did it and try to maintain what they have given us instead of tearing it down. (one last note: It is land owners like J. Paolino who cause great historical landmarks such as the Brewery to fall into disrepar and allow them to get into a state of no return.)


(**A.I.R.**: Thanks for the info, Steve. Just a slight correction, the former site of the Narragansett Brewery is not the site of the current Cranston Parkade [KMart, Lowes, etc‚Ä¶]. That land was undeveloped until about 2000 ‚Äî we checked via aerial photos.)'

It happend that we needed Narragansett Beer bar glasses for the commercial, and John MacNabo (sp), the brewery president, took me into the barn where they stored all the beer advertising paraphenalia. It was pretty cavernous, and most of it was unused by then. We took the last 8 gold-rimmed Narragnasett beer glasses out of that place, and used them for the shoot. I still have 4 of them.


We used to meet regularly in the main brewery building, in the BrewMaster‚Äôs room, which was an ornate, dark-panelled Germanesque room with a large, leather-covered conference room table in the center. At one end of the oval table, 3 draught handles stood at attention. You had your choice (yes, even at a 9 am meeting) of fresh-tapped Narragansett Lager, porter (which was really good), or ale.

Does everyone remember that commercial in the 70‚Äôs where it shows an Indian with a tear running down his face and as the camera backs away it shows a polluted stream?

For about 2 years in high school I got to work at the Arena (we always called it "the Arena" or "the Auditorium")- what a blast! I got to know the building pretty well. I even got to work Reds games for a while as a "skate boy", where I got to skate on the ice during intermissions and move the goals for the Zamboni machine. I got to know a few of the Reds players and coach Wilson a little too. My best Reds memory was probably the time after a morning Reds practice when 2-3 of the workers, including me, went across the street to the Penalty Box bar (the drinking age was 18 then) with Bob "Battleship" Kelley and had some beers.

I wan‚Äôt even driving yet, but I met a girl, Cathy M., that summer in Narragansett. After vacation was over, she went back home to Providence. I called her on the phone and asked her to go to the concert with me. My father drove me to her house, picked her up, and brought us both to the concert. He had a few beers at the Penalty Box (the corner bar) while waiting for the concert to be over, and then we drove Cathy back home after the show. Lost touch with Cathy after that, but always cherished that memory. And by the way, @Robert Fagan, I did get to go to that Doors concert and met Jim Morrison! Sorry.'

  content: 'I lived the first 17 years (1945 to 1963) of my life a few blocks from the Arena at 1187 North Main. I would love to hear from any others that lived near the Arena in that time period. I came from a poor family and would never have seen anything more entertaining than TV in my childhood had it not been for the Arena. My brothers worked parking cars there. So between that and the many ways to sneak in or sometimes just hang around by the front entrance and someone would give away an extra ticket. So I saw the Reds, Celtics, Ice Capades, rodeos (one with Jock Mahoney, the Range Rider).  I was there the night his partner during a fake fight broke his arm. I was there when a circus performer fell from the high wire into the stands.  Fortunately he only broke some bones. I remember seeing many stars like Bobby Darren. I knew many of the rink rats (kids that hung around the Arena and got as much ice time as they could. Some went on to become great hockey players in High School and College like Bobby Goudreau, Bosco (Dennis) Sweeney.  Speaking of High School hockey, all schools played at the Arena in that era with several games a night (for one admission) one after the other. Kids from all over the state went and spent the night there watching hockey, socializing and many couples meet each other that way. It was a great time.  I had the pleasure only once of appearing on stage at the Arena.  I played a Roman Soldier in a passion play. I kissed my first girl backstage. '

  content: 'Wow! How wonderful to see that the lithograph used to show the RI Auditorium happens to be showing the fight with my Godfather/Uncle, Tiger Ted Lowry and Marciano. Personally, I hated fights and never went to watch a single bout. Actually, I was too young to attend that boxing match.<br>
However, I distinctly remember the night of that particular fight (shown in the picture). After that fight family and friends came back to our home.  There was a lot of conversation regarding my Uncle Ted and the fact that he actually won the fight that night. Family and friends have contended that he won the fight, ‚ÄúHands down‚Äù. For years this would be the sentiment of the folks that attended that fight actually believed he won. My Uncle never commented one way or another about what he thought!


Years and I mean many, many years later I over heard that the fight was lost because my Uncle‚Äôs family‚Äôs lives would be in jeopardy... if he won the fight. Go figure, it was back in the day and well, no need to add anything more to the point! So, so many people felt that he won the fight and this was a topic of any conversation on the East Side of Providence amid the local boxing scholars for years and years.


When I asked Uncle Ted if it was true about his family being threatened‚Ä¶ he would say, ‚ÄúMarciano is not here to defend himself so I will not answer the question.‚Äù My Uncle was a wonderful and decent man! He finally realized his life‚Äôs dream when he wrote his life story and had the first copy of his book actually in his hand. The title of the book is ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs in My Corner‚Äù and should you decide to purchase the book, remember that ‚ÄúTiger Ted Lowry‚Äù was in his eighties when he completed it, and up to the last two years of his life‚Ä¶ he could tell you about his fights and amid other interesting facets of his long life.


I was so very lucky to have him in my life. He was the second person to hold me when I was born. My dad was a tad over the limits of celebrating my birth and my mother would not allow him to hold me‚Ä¶ LOL.


So, again, it was a wonderful surprise to see this picture here and in my office I have the same picture beautifully framed. I have had it for more than 13 years.


One final note, the man that created this lithograph attended my Uncle‚Äôs 80th birthday party in Connecticut nearly 11 years ago. My Uncle cherished that gift. He has gone on to meet his maker. He died in June 2009. He was married to Alice Lowry and she too‚Ä¶is a beautiful person, they were simply a beautiful couple. RIP Uncle Ted!'

My Dad and two uncles used to have season tickets and would bring me along twice per week. They knew one of the ticket takers at the door who would let me in for free. I used to carry and bring-in my own little folding chair and would sit in front of one of the building support columns and be next to my Dad. I even had a plastic horn which my Dad had made for me, even had a mouthpiece on it and that horn was loud! I‚Äôm sure many people had seen me sitting in front of that particular column every Sunday night and many Wednesdays. I was fortunate no employees ever threw my Dad out because I never had a ticket!


I remember seeing a live chicken or two and chairs getting thrown on the ice when the Reds weren‚Äôt doing so well. I remember several of the Reds players. Only one wore a helmet that I remember during that time (Alton White?). Even Marcel P. (our beloved goaltender) didn‚Äôt wear a face mask! I remember one particular game against the Rochester Americans where the Reds had scored over 15 goals! I had never seen a hockey team lose the game and their moral soooo badly as on that night!


The only thing I really disliked about that arena? I‚Äôll never forget the cigarette smoke. It used to fill the arena sooo bad by the third period you could cut it with a knife!  Talk about danger of second-hand cigarette smoke? Holy crap it was bad, but seeing the Reds play hockey twice per week when I was just a kid?? It sure was worth it! Many a time in the start of the 3rd period my Dad would allow me to change seats. He knew I hated the cigarette smoke, so he let me go look below where I‚Äôd always find an empty seat for myself! I‚Äôd sometimes sit in the first row right-up against the glass!! What a thrill it was for me who didn‚Äôt even have a ticket and never thought of such things!!'

Add in some decent pizza and Gansett on tap and you‚Äôd be the most popular spot in town.

At a certain point in the 1980s Sears made a strange business decision that it would close all the free-standing Sears complexes in the USA. It would only continue to operate the Sears stores that were part of large suburban shopping malls. While many could argue that this saves on marketing, because other stores help bring in the customers, it also appeared to be another anti-urban decision by a large retailer. Even now, Wal-Mart‚Äôs approach is to begin thinking about urban areas only when the rural and suburban markets are saturated.


In the mid-1980s, some of my friends bought their first suits at theAndersen Little. The underground bowling alley was open long after the Sears complex closed. The combination of duckpins and the small bowling balls is something that is extremely difficult to find these days. This is a unique aspect of New England culture that has largely disappeared.'

The Sears I worked for was a by-gone era... the department stores that have survived did so by moving into malls and amalgamating their personalities with that of those stores around them.

It was a great job, but a crazy time to work for Sears in hindsight, because it was when the retail giant took some really big chances that did not pan out. Sears closed its catalog, overdiversified in financial services and real estate, began selling other brand name products through Brand Central, tried to convert underperforming community-stores into HomeLife specialty stores [furniture], and then started accepting other credit cards besides Sears and Discover. Anyway, now that they cleaned up the old Automotive, maybe they will do something with the main store. Between that and Anderson Little, it looks pretty bad. That area has a lot of history, the old Lowes Drive-in and, way before that, the <a href="/property/cyclodrome/">Cyclodrome</a>, which was where the drive-in was, became the first spot to host an NFL game under lights [Providence Steamrollers vs. Chicago cardinals], Chip‚Äôs underground bowling alley, the list goes on.

(The other two were Haven Brothers and The Silver Truck.) Many a time did the Silver Top save me from going to bed drunk and hungry, instead of just drunk. One night, we showed up at about 2 am, in a group of about 10 guys, 10 of whom were wasted and 4 of whom (including myself) still had on costumes and makeup from a goofball fraternity ritual earlier in the evening. (We looked like a cross between the band ‚ÄúKiss‚Äù and Marylin Manson.) After engaging in our usual ritual of debating, in front of the waitress, whether to order large sodas or smalls (both were listed on the menu, but we could never perceive any difference in the size of the glasses), some cops came over to our table, and asked, in a menacing tone, what was up with the costumes. Even AFTER they had explained to us that some costumed ex-con had robbed and pistol whipped a gas station attendant in the neighborhood the night before (it was late October, and Halloween was in full swing), my even-drunker-than-I-was friend started getting all agitated and blurting out ‚ÄúMiranda‚Äù this and ‚Äú4th Amendment‚Äù that. I kicked my friend in the shins and calmly explained to the cops that we were just your average drunken college kids doing sophomoric, stupid, but relatively harmless college kid stuff. They let us go, we proceeded to enjoy our foot-long chili cheese dogs, and I ended up becoming a lawyer. I owe it to the Silver Top for discovering that I had it in me.'

Back in my carousing days (the mid to late 90s) the night wasn‚Äôt over until I stopped at the Silver Top for a huge breakfast. When the diner hit its peak in the early morning, every stool at the counter was occupied; late arriving friends would squeeze into an already crowded booth. The jukebox would come to life. People would shout orders to the (amazing) wait staff, and they would shout to the cooks. It was very noisy. A line would form at the door. It was always almost chaos. But somehow seats were found for everyone. Your cup was filled with coffee. The kitchen didn‚Äôt explode under the pressure, as you almost feared it might, but sent you your food, exactly as you ordered. It was rarely not hot, and always good. Part of the Silver Top‚Äôs appeal to me was the oddball clientele someone mentioned above ‚Äî rockers from Lupos, night-owls, frat boys, gays and drag queens, students, downcity ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù, and who knows who, or what, else. In my experience everybody got along pretty peaceably. It was only the drunks or the occasional rude customer causing a problem. I forget the name of the Silver Top‚Äôs owner at the time but I always admired her skill at running the place, and wished her success keeping the doors open in the teeth of so much upheaval, with Providence Place going up and the old markets adjacent dead or relocated. It couldn‚Äôt have been easy. Around then the crowd I ran with decamped to the Seaplane on Allens Avenue, closer to the clubs we went to. We went less and less often to the Silver Top. My days of drinking and clubbing, and big breakfasts, were over.


It seems ironic (and ill-omened) that the city that invented diners is in its so-called renaissance uprooting the Silver Top, forcing it to join its sister, the Modern Diner, in Pawtucket. So many of the places that kept the city alive (well, barely) in its Medieval Era, are being pushed out, shut down, moved to the periphery; in the way of the next new, essential parking garage or luxury condo heliport. Well, no good deed ever goes unpunished. If those small shops and alley bars and live music clubs hadn‚Äôt stayed behind, making not only noise but money, when every other business pulled up stakes, Providence might still be known as that place you drive through to get to Cape Cod. Cities evolve, like everything else. But I cling to the belief that a city is, above all, an open, not a gated, community, belonging to anyone who wants to work and live in it. After a good early start remaking downcity for everyone‚Äôs benefit, now private interests seem in the saddle. What they‚Äôll make of the city remains to be seen, but I doubt the result will be anywhere near as welcoming and open to all as the Silver Top. I think I‚Äôll like the new skyline, though. '

We entered one or two of the buildings and took photos around the exterior but eventually we explored further into one building. We went up onto different floors and saw some really eerie stuff...old bed frames and bit‚Äôs of furnishings and remnants of the facility. We actually discovered a great old long wooden table, and old hospital bedside table, and some other odd &amp; ends and carried them out to our car. We took these things home and cleaned them up painted them and used them in our apartment for a period of time.'

My 90-year old mother‚Äôs, uncle, Albert McEachern, was an East Providence artist and, according to his obituary, he painted many murals in homes, churches and other buildings in East Providence, including one in the East Providence Masonic Temple. He also painted a mural in the Second Baptist Church in East Providence in 1939, which was dedicated to his wife, Florence A (Bayers) McEachern. I know that the church is still there, but is now a Russian church. I am planning a trip to Providence in Sept. and would like to know if anyone can help me to determine if there is a Masonic Temple in East Providence that would have been there in the 1930s. Does the name of the artist Albert McEachern mean anything to anyone? He, also, painted murals, with a maritime theme, in may East Side homes.Many thanks. rpearce1 [at] nycap [dot] rr [dot] com'

I grew up in R.I., went to college in Providence and recall this building as being boarded up as long as I lived in the state. Durng my stay at the hotel I invited some old local friends to visit and check out the rennovated place. One acquaintance remembered breaking in about 30 years ago and recounted his observations of the interior just as these photos show it. Lots of graffiti! While downstairs at the restaurant, he called me over to a hall by the door and pointed out a number of large prints of what I saw as abstract art. On closer inspection, I could see that it was all graffiti from the inside of the original structure! I later noticed similar prints throughout the hotel and in the room I was staying in. It looks like the old WAS preserved within the new after all!'

It was such a beautiful building once you got up top into what felt like the bones of an auditorium ‚Äì the moonlight streaming in through the holes in the roof. An amazing place, and peaceful till you realized that the holes above you corresponded roughly to the piles of concrete debris on the floor all around you. Nothing ever came crashing down while I was in there though.


There was a creepy building next door at the time that we‚Äôd gone into once or twice. Some sort of residence with lots of rooms and twisted hallways. It always felt like you were gonna find a corpse in there ‚Äì seriously. Made the brave move one night to open one of the refridgerators in there. Unbelievably it was still full of food, though it was long past the point where you could recognize anything that wasn‚Äôt labelled.

Then climbing up the rickety stairs until we got to the top floor. There is not an inch along the walls not covered in graffiti and the humongous top floor was astounding. We tried out the rope swing that hangs from the skeleton that was once a roof. We had to be careful to only swing from the end with the elevator shafts because if you swing from the opposite, and higher, side you will have too much slack and go crashing to the floor as my friend did.

My family and I (wife &amp; 5 children) lived in the supt‚Äôs house. Our youngest daughter, Jeanne, was christened in the chapel on the grounds by the Catholic priest (forgot his name) whose parish was in W Warwick. Bill Gaulin was the mainstay of the staff of the training school. He and his wife and children lived on Sockanosett Rd in a very old, white house. Bill was not happy when I became supt because I was a liberal and he wasn‚Äôt, at least he pretended he wasn‚Äôt. I had to go to a meeting in NY one day and called Bill in and told him I was going to be away for 4 days and would he please take care of the kids. He said, ‚ÄúI suppose you want me to give him candy!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about right.‚Äù I knew what he meant and he knew what I meant and from that day on we got along famously.


We had two Picards, father and son, working as Youth Supervisors. They too came from W Warwick as did most of the staff. Old man Picard, as he was know, had a beautiful German Shepard Dog, when she had puppies he gave us one whom we named Princess. She was a part of our family for 14 years, a great dog. Many memories come flooding back- I have a lot of stories to tell-by the way, one more...


I was away one evening giving a speech and there was a little ‚Äúto-do‚Äù with one or two of the boys. Ray Palmer, Sr. Supv now deceased, a great guy, called our house and asked for me.

**Medical Examiner Seeks Help To Identify Bones**, 06-24-2006 3:42 AMs


(Providence, RI) ‚Äî The state Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office has confirmed that bones found in the Garden City section of Cranston are human remains. The bones were found Thursday afternoon by a work crew digging in the area. The ME‚Äôs Office says the identification of the bones as being human was made visually by an anthropologist at the University of Maine. The investigation will continue in an attempt to provide further information about the remains.


(**A.I.R.**: It was later determined that the bones originated from a forgotten graveyard on the site.)'

I understand that this building has had a rather bad recent few years with all that ‚ÄúRoger W.‚Äù stated below but common sense should tell you that this building is NOT better leveled than rehabbed. If rehabbed properly, the property values around this location would go UP! While some regard this as tax trouble, others regard this as a good investment made better. I have seen these sorts of buildings razed for other plans and the result is always awful! The architect of today is not given the tools to make a building as beautifull as this. This is something that can ONLY be made prior to WWII. I have always said that if a building cannot be made again in the same style without a 9 figure grant, it shouldn‚Äôt be torn down! Historic scenery enhances a place. Why more people don‚Äôt understand this, is baffeling!? I understand the owners have a business nearby that requires more parking and that is why they want to erase this piece of history and fine example of a bygone era in architecture. Where I come from, we call that squandering and selfish. Pure and simple. Many years ago I tried in vein to do what I could to save the Manton and Fruithill Avenue school but was uncomfortabley way out of my league. It was demolished in 2002 and is now the site of a very unattractive 1 story building. Why anyone would want something like this to happen again is unimaginable. We as a city need to support groups like the preservation society so that landowners like this do not destroy our beautifull landscape one bad idea at a time. I beleive the penalty for this infraction of demo without proper permission is $500 a day. Is this a joke? I knew it would be low but what kind of arrogant land developer wouldn‚Äôt ignore this and rip into it if it may cost $500 a day? This is an outrage. The very first thing that should be done is to raise that amount to something that would be quite inconvenient. That cost wouldn‚Äôt deter even the poorest of developers.

The shallow disregard is made so very clear with the ‚Äúeyesore‚Äù and ‚Äújealousy‚Äù comments from those who hold no value on their history and culture, and only see their own ego or personal gain as the main priority. I wish the best to those who have not forsaken community values and wish to preserve these structures. It is wise for all of us to hold our elected officials responsible in being proper guardians for these public properties. The Grove St. School, like many, was likely sold to pad public coffers and offset some red ink, but no regard for the fate of this historic structure was included in this sale.

His selflessness stood out when he was alive and is still praised to this day by all that knew him. He loved this neighborhood as much as he loved his own family and friends. Mr. Tarro, as well as his own father was a State Representative for the area and had only Federal Hill‚Äôs best intersts at heart. He was a stand up guy that put his name to anything and everything that he believed in and his children are and will continue to do the same with their Family business and in their own lives. As for the ‚ÄúTarro Boys‚Äù, obviously you do not know them either, because ALL the Tarro children, not just the boys, share the same generous, selflessness traits that both their parents passed on to them. I have always been told that jealousy is the root of all evil, and it could not be clearer that it centers your world.

Anyway, as teenagers, my brother and I helped Zam during the summer months ‚Äî I handled the front providing full service to customers (gas, oil, air, water... Oh, those overheated radiators were tough), and my brother helped Zam with car repairs in the shop. The place was like a Barney Miller sitcom ‚Äî we had many ‚Äúold guy‚Äù visitors such as ‚ÄúSmitty‚Äù (Yankee fan), ‚ÄúOld Pop‚Äù (Red Sox fan), and of course, ‚ÄúThe Chief‚Äù, a Narragansett Indian who also worked with Zam during the winter and would visit in the summer to teach us how we could survive in the woods with a nail and a piece of string! It was a neighborhood with many African Americans (we were Italian) at a time (late 60s and 70s) when there was a lot of tension between blacks and whites ‚Äî but many of our customers were black and we all got along so well ‚Äî it shaped the person I am today, and I am proud of that.'

As a child I spent alot of time with her as she grew older. Initially, you could just walk into the building and either climb the stairs to infinity or push a button and take the elevator. The whole building was made of rebarb enforced concrete. Every two apartments shared a 6&quot; x 12&quot; concrete porch with a green corragated plastic sheet which covered the chain link fence to ensure privacy from those below. My grandmother used to like to sun bathe on her lawn chair with her iced coffee by her side. Her apartment (also concrete throughout) was always styling. You would never smell moth balls when you walked into her pad! She always had the latest and greatest furniture and decor of the day and the place was always spotless. She had current pictures of the family on the walls and of course there was the religeous pictures which hung in every room. I believe the only thing she had that was ‚Äúold‚Äù was a picture of her mother, which sat in a ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù frame. Then of course there was the neighbors. Mrs. Early down at the end of the building, who would waddle her way up and down the front catwalk, snapping her gum with the three teeth she had left and looking to strike up a conversation with whoever was willing. Mary Weston, who lived a few doors down had a million stories to tell about her life and the people in it. I would sit in her apartment and listen to her stories and she would feed me. After my grandmother died I would still visit the folks at 22 Whelan Road. It made me feel a little closer to the memory of my grandmother and I still loved to hear the neighbors re-runs. There were alot of people who lived in the apartments of all four big buildings. They all had a life, a history, a story to tell. And they all mattered. As they all died off they left their legacy within the halls, walls and stairwells of those big buildings. And now... it‚Äôs all gone, as if none of it ever mattered.  '

In 1960, my family moved from a cold-water tenement (2 bedrooms, no hot water) to this building, apartment 6L. We had 3 bedrooms, one for the 3 boys, one for the 3 girls, and 1 for my parents. The building was a hotbed of crime at the time and got worse after. But I was VERY happy to have grown up in that housing project, and to this date, 46 years after I moved in, I am still friendly with many of the similarly situated neighbors. I look on my 12 years living in the project as WONDERFUL. I worked in 2 nearby stores, Bills Variety, and Lanes Spa, and also worked in Joe‚Äôs Shell Station. Those jobs enabled me to know EVERY resident of the project, with hundreds of apartments. I went on to work for the police department, and retired in 1989. The building, VERY well constructed, took 3 months to demolish with a swinging ball. Every apartment was replaced by what is called scattered site housing, much better modern housing for our lower income fellow citizens. '

My cousin Joe, Bob, Paul, Ed, Bruce, and I spent almost every day either on the midway or at the pool in the summers of 1962-1966. One of our mothers would drive us to the park, give us couple bucks and would pick us up around 4. The pool took a token worth .50 and Sue was always there to let us through the turnstile. What a beautiful girl, we were all smitten. We were 11-12 and she was 15-16, always wore animal skin looking bathing suits. Enough of that, we would swim and listen to pop music piped over load speaker systems, it had a three tier diving board, we would dive off the first two but that 3rd one was way up their. After a while we would leave, get a hand stamp to get back in (from Sue) and either go on the midway or jump on the trampolines on the water front. The midway was a great experience to observe and walk, sometimes stepping on a lit cigarette butt barefoot not fully extinguished, ouch ouch, they had rides, penny arcade (yes using real pennies back then) and food vendors, but best of all side shows. I remember seeing a Freak Show, that was real strange, a guy looking like Buffalo Bill pounding spikes into his head, up his nose, through his lips, and not bleeding.

But when we got there, it  was worth the wait. Dad knew the owner, Conrad. Dad was a Teamster, so we had the company picnics there. When I was a kid, I wanted to go on the rides and not go into the Shore Dinner Hall. Then at an older age it was the Shore Dinner Hall and not the rides. I just couldn‚Äôt take the horizontal spins. Great memories of Rocky Point. Sad to see it go.'

I can remember my dad taking us on the Wild Cat and rocking it at the top before it dived down. We were so scared, but we went on it everytime. Eating in the Chowder House was like nothing I‚Äôve ever experenced before. It was HUGE. People just sat near each other and shared bowl and bowls of chowder and cakes.  We were there when it was not crowded and I remember  sometimes waiting to get in. I have a picture of me and my dad at the Rocky Point Bar with hats on and holding up empty bottles of Falstaff. We took my sister‚Äôs first boyfriend there with us. She was about 15. I remember her boyfriend prucking all over the place on the Spider. My dad and I were laughing. He had to buy a shirt. My sister got one to match. When I was dating my husband, we use to go there every weekend and walk around. He would fish off the rocks and I would sunbath. We‚Äôd eat chowder and cakes to go and just hang. When we had kids, we brought them there every weekend also to sit on the rocks and eat, or go into the park. It never mattered to them if they rode the rides or not. Sometimes we would just hang out and people watch. The House of Horrors was my favorite ride. Onetime we were watiching fireworks on the grass and we were so close the cardboard from the fireworks were coming down around us. It was so cool. Thank you for this blog. It has brought back many many happy memories.'

I worked there in the summer at the redemption center with ‚Äúmama Leake‚Äù and sometimes at the game booths. It was a huge part of my growing up experience. I can remember the salt water pool with the 3 diving boards, the rides, the concerts the fire works, the food (Chowda and clam cakes!) my first kiss ever was in the haunted house! It was just such a wonderful place... an amusement park where you could go have fun ride the rides and smell the ocean! They used to have the show near the top of the midway where they would shoot a man out of a cannon to! Life now is so hectic, busy and commercialized, I love six flags but it just doesn‚Äôt have the same feel that rocky point had.  my uncle was a year round employee of the park and I spent many winter vacations from school at the arcarde with him and hanging around with all the other people from the park. I can remember at the end of the nights in the summer, the counting room for all the money was in the back of the redemption center, after all was counted my uncle (who did the evening drops at the bank) would pull his car up the midway and they would load bag after bag of money into his old dodge until the back of the car almost was dragging to the ground! I went there yesterday (sunday the 4th)  along with lots and lots of other people. What a disgrace this, to have let this beautiful and historic part of rhode island fall into disarray I sat an creid yesterday afternoon just looking at what had become of this treasure. It was like being in a movie and so surreal. You could almost hear the ghosts of all the people in the wind... Rocky point was such a special place, it should be reborn into something special that everyone can use and enjoy!

  content: 'I am so excited to have found this site. My husband and I spent the day at Six Flags a couple days ago and I found myself talking a lot about Rocky Point (he‚Äôs not a native Rhode Islander). The memories were so strong that I had to Google it yesterday and I ended up here. I read other people‚Äôs memories and I was so overcome with emotion and nostalgia that I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Rocky Point was a HUGE part of my childhood. My dad used to take my older sister and me, infrequently at first in the mid 70s when we were just little kids because at that time there were other parks he‚Äôd take us to as well, like Crescent Park and Jolly Cholly‚Äôs, then we started going more frequently in the late 70s, early 80s. We‚Äôd go practically every Sunday in the summer, sometimes every other Sunday, back when they used the different combinations of the colored string bracelets with the colored jaw clasp to designate admission on the different days. We couldn‚Äôt wait to hear the jingle on the radio because that meant that school was out and Rocky Point was open! Dad had an El Camino then and on some days he‚Äôd let us ride in the back and we would jabber the whole way about which rides we were going to go on, and how we were gonna ram each other on the Bumper Cars, and were we brave enough to finally try the Enterprise?  I remember sitting in traffic that would sometimes start a mile or so back from the entrance and we would practically be jumping out of skins with anticipation and excitement. We would be crawling along and be so happy once we passed the ‚ÄúRocky Point‚Äù sign and got into the park. We‚Äôd ride the Musik Express and be so happy when the DJ played a song we liked. We would watch the Tilt-A-Whirl to see which car spun the most and then we‚Äôd grab that one. I‚Äôll never forget how scared I was to go on the Enterprise the first time only to realize how much I LOVED it and would ride it countless times after that. The Cyclone was one of our absolute favorite rides and we must have ridden that thing 10 times during each visit, I can still remember how my stomach would flutter when we flew down that first hill.  How we loved to ride the Flume only to scream if we got too wet or the water was too cold! And I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizza! I remember one time my sister was playing the ring toss game because she desperately wanted to win one of the big stuffed bears, while I impatiently pleaded with her to stop playing and ride the rides with me, which she finally did.  At one point, we got off one of the rides (I think the Musik Express) and there was Dad holding the bear she so wanted so badly! He had played and played that stupid game until he won it for her. Dad would finally say it was time to go, and we would PLEAD for just one more ride, usually the Musik Express or the Cyclone. When we got older into our teens and my sister got her license, we would go with our friends and then it was all about riding the rides and noticing BOYS! This was mid-to-late 80s and the park was still always packed and we would still sit in traffic to get in and we would STILL be excited to ride the rides! In the early 90s, I would go with my boyfriend or my friends and it was still fun, but not as much. I‚Äôm not sure why that is, maybe because there was a different crowd of people that started frequenting the place. Gone were the days when Dad could sit on one of the benches and read the Sunday Journal while his two young daughters would safely roam the park. Also, some of it may have been that I was in my early 20s and at that age, you are in such a rush to grow up and enter adulthood, I think maybe you start to disassociate from many things which symbolize your childhood, which RP definitely did for me. Anyway, I think the last time I went while RP still had rides was maybe 93 or 94, I was with a bunch of friends and I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I may even have deemed the park as ‚Äúlame‚Äù. The very last time I was there was October 98, there was some Halloween-themed event going on (which really WAS lame), and that was it. Maybe about 4 years ago, my husband and I went to visit some friends who live not far from RP and I wanted to drive by to see what was left. When I saw the sign in disrepair and looking so, I don‚Äôt know, ignored and unloved (crazy, I know, but that‚Äôs what it looked like), I burst into tears. You don‚Äôt really begin to treasure precious memories until you are older and more mature and have a broader, wiser perspective on things, and nostalgia sets in. Now I‚Äôm 39 and my dad is very ill, which rips my heart apart and makes me cry very easily. Reliving these memories is both exhilaratingly wonderful and terribly heartbreaking. The knowledge that Rocky Point is gone and the fate of its property in the hands of greedy soul-sucking developers is bad enough, but I hate that treasuring these memories occurred so belatedly, after the time has already passed to fight for RP‚Äôs survival. I wish it was still here. If I close my eyes, I can still see us sitting in the parking lot in the back of Dad‚Äôs El Camino, eating clam cakes and throwing the scraps to the seagulls.'

Ill never forget it. My dad was in charge of all the games and the redemption center. Jeremiah F Leake, my grandfather was in charge of the main office. My brothers Jerry and Brian worked the midway. My sister Angela worked in the office. My sister Maureen was about to get married and reside in maryland. As for me [Kathy] my twin [Karen] and our brother Kevin and our beautiful Mom we visited almost everyday. We could ride any ride we wanted for free because we were Jerrys kids. Everyone knew who we were, we got away with nothing.The flume water ride was forbidden, to many accidents. Ill never for get the fire works on the 4 of july by the water. The best!!!!!! My dad told us to stay away from the gypsys b/c they would steal us. My dad just did not want us to go to that side of the park. Who Knows! I heard that gypsys wanted to buy my dad when he was a baby. Maybe thats why he said that .Ill never know. My dad Jerry DiCapua died on July the 9, after working 4 of july weekend in the park at the Family Kingdom in Myrtle beach,SC. The amusement park was his life, his love besides my mom of 59 years. Everyone who knew my dad LOVED him as his family did. He was funny,smart,handsome and had a quick left,and a right. I am sure he was a pain in the ass every now and then. [right Mom].

I worked in the food stands because I was underage and could not work the rides or the games. I landed the job as the shift manager at the cotton candy stand and all of my friends made fun of me because it was a sticky job and you always smelled like candy floss. I just grinned and barred it. The stand was right at the outdoor stage and I saw every band and stage show that came to the park. No one bought cotton candy during the shows. I was great. As a local kid we knew every way to seek in. There were holes in the fence behind the House of Horrors and up in the woods at the top end of the flume. I wonder why no one ever fixed them. We used to sneak in after the park closed and look for money that fell out patrons pockets under the Music Express. We always left with some money. I also remember the salt water pool with the high diving platforms. It was a lot of scary fun for a kid. You don‚Äôt find anything like it now.

I can best describe my experiences at Rocky Point as ‚ÄúI had a blast‚Äù.  I practically ran from ride to ride so that I could ‚Äúfit‚Äù as much as possible into one day. I remember getting sick a couple of times, vomiting in the barrels. The tossing and turning of the rides didn‚Äôt always agree with my eating plenty of the shore dinner. Even with that, I had to practically be restrained to keep me from immediately running back to the rides. Rocky Point was like a heaven for kids. When I was there, I felt like ‚Äúthis must be heaven‚Äù, it was the greatest! Even as an adult, it seems to me that it is a part of my childhood that I shall never outgrow, the scarier, the faster, the more challenging the better. I was deeply saddened to learn of the park‚Äôs closing, such a loss to not only Rhode Island, but to New England. I miss Rocky Point, and I wish they‚Äôd bring it back! I think they should build a hotel somewhere on the grounds with a view of the ocean. Hotel guests could take their kids to the park to bring in more heads.

My grandfather‚Äôs famous phrase when we were kids was: ‚ÄúDo you guys want to go to Rocky Point?‚Äù  We eagerly said: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù His response was: ‚ÄúThen start walking!‚Äù LOL. Man, all I can say about RP is that it felt dreamy going there as kids. I visited last when I was 18-19, just prior to it closing. I had thought about it many times over the past 20 years, but just recently my lady and I were in the Warwick area. Being that she is not from R.I., I took her there and I was very disappointed to see how the entrance was locked up, along with the many signs reminding outsiders to keep out. It made me just really want to cry seeing one of the only theme and amusement parks in this state just go complete bankrupt. You would think that this state would just fund the park for the good of all its residents. Frankly, RP is a landmark and will always remain a landmark and a place where memories will never be lost. Let‚Äôs petition for it to come back or something. I wonder what would happen if we parked the car and went in. Very macabre like, but very indulging at the same time :)'

My father ran security at the park from the middle 70s (after Eddie Silva, Warwick PD) until the late 80s. May of you will remember SGT. then LT. Jim Godbout from the Warwick PD. We thought that RP was our very own playground! I remember coming through the gate, getting our hand stamped by Mr. Ferla or Mr Casciolli(sp?). Conrad gave me my first job at the shore dinner hall in 79, washing dishes with big Jim Kelly, and learning to make clamcakes with Julio. I will always remember the words ‚ÄúCHOWDER DOWN BOYS‚Äù, that meant we had to carry one of those steaming cauldrons down to the takeout window. In 82 I went to work for the games division, and my summers were a blast! I met more girls than you could shake a stick at! I even ran the Whack A mole game when they brought it in. Being a gamer at RP was a blast. I continued working there until 84 when I graduated from Hendricken, and joined the Marines. My sister, Lori Greaves, and her husband Jeff, had their reception at the Windjammer. Do you remember Agnes? I miss that tough old bird! She use to smoke unfiltered Luck Strikes! The last time that I went to the park was 1987 with my wife. She had never ridden a loop coaster until the corkscrew, and will never again. She was 6 months pregnant with our first son, and she was shaking so bad that she could not stand up to get off the ride. So as I look at the pictures of what is left of that wonderful place from my childhood, it fills me with great sadness. It is a shame that another generation will never get to watch the fireworks from behind the office. Get that first kiss in the house of horrors or enjoy that special Rhode Island treat of clam cakes and chowder. And to all of our friends that are still up there, Jim, Kathy, Jori, and Jon are all here in Charleston SC and doing fine. I can be reached at retailtuna [at] yahoo [dot] com.

Immediately Rocky Point Amusement Park came to mind. What a fun time back in the 30‚Äôs. My folks loved the Chowda. When I saw your web site it made me both smile remembering the fun and sad that the park is no longer there. The memories live on however. '

  content: 'Oh how i remember Rocky Point Park. It‚Äôs so very sad they had to end a wonderful family park it was. I will always remember the Pool. I use to dive off the diving board with my two sisters and brother. We had so much fun going down the slide and just haveing fun. I remember the House of Horrors. I was so scared when i was a little girl but as i got older i knew it wasn‚Äôt true. I went in there over and over again. I use to go on the spider but not very many times because i didn‚Äôt like it when it went around and around. I use to get sick as a dog when it went around. Then comes the bumper cars. I use to love going on them several times in a row. Then it was the Skee ball. I loved getting all those tickets and then cashing them in and getting prizes. The skydiver was fun too!!! And then comes the rockets. I use to love the rockets. I rode them over and over again. I loved to go high in the sky as a kid. It sure was fun. Then the musik Express and boy did it go fast forward and then backwards. I loved it. Then the skyliner after you go on the flume. It somewhat made you dry from the sea air. You could smell the sea air up high in the sky. It sure was fun. On hot days you go on the flume just to cool off and get dry on the skyliner. What a way to go!!! I loved the train ride just to slow down a bit. What a shame that this family playground is all gone. Those are great pictures of the park but it‚Äôs not the same. I sure miss you Rocky Point. I was with you all during the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs and it sure was fun. It was a family gathering for all families until one day it‚Äôs gone. But the memories in my heart will never fade away. I LOVE YOU ROCKY POINT!!! YOU‚ÄôLL ALWAYS BE IN MY HEART FOREVER!!!!!!!!!'

We took  buses there, the school had packed lunch for us (subs, chips, soda) which I remember eating outside the park in the lot near the Corkscrew.  I remember being completely immature and there were porta potties near a cliff and while my friend was in one we all started shaking it and she started screaming.  I remember spitting at each other while riding on the swings. I remember loving the Musik Express and the Flume. The corkscrew was fun. My favorite ride was the Free Fall, which kept breaking every two minutes. I remember one or two times it broke while we were on it. That ride was so much fun.  I remember one ride which was this little car that was on a ferris like wheel. You‚Äôd sit in it with another person and there was a wheel you could spin that would make the car spin around. I got so sick in that! I nearly lost my lunch! That was the only time I went there. My neighbors went many times with their family. It‚Äôs so sad that it closed. I will have to buy the dvd to keep the memories fresh in my mind. '

We would watch fireworks every 4th of July on the grass near the flume. We would swim in the pool all summer long. My Dad taught me how to hit a baseball at the batting range. Eating clamcakes and chowder at the Shore Dinner Hall. Puking on the Rock n Roll and never riding a ride like that ever again. Dad shooting out the star in the BB gun game. Riding the train. Playing all of the outdated games in the arcade‚Ä¶ I could go on with my flow of memories from Rocky Point but I will stop there.

She would stamp the hands of the swimmers as they would enter the pool pavillion. I remember watching Billy Ross on the highest driving board, he was stricken by electricution and lost both arms. He had one stub, but after he dove, he could still swim to get out of the pool. Anyone who saw him, could not believe it, what a sight. I also was a summer resident of ROCKY BEACH every summer from the Fifties, with my parents, Grandparents, and the BEST of all, is where I met my BEST FRIEND in the world, LINDA DEQUARTTRO! She is still my best friend to this very day. We have been friends for at least fifty years. We  would go to ROCKY POINT as little girls, and sit in her mother, Artea‚Äôs ticket booth for hours. She was the HEAD cashier, at the MAIN ticket booth, in the center of the park, next to the CASTLE OF TERROR. We could not it for the day that we would be old enough to work there. My sister Doreen Stephen also worked there, with her best friend JANET CHAFFEE. By the way Janet, i read yor anecdote, and it was wonderful that you mentioned Doreen and I. We can also remember all the Fourth  of July‚Äôs, watching the best fireworks ever,  on the beach near the pool. It was fabulous. At the time we worked at the park Mark Scala was manager and before that it was Conrad Ferls. He would ride through the park, on a motor scooter, checking things out. We had the time of our lives. I will never forget it. The concerts, I rember JANIS JOPLIN for free!! And i will never  forget the free acts, the best being THE ZACCKINIS, ANNON BALL as they out of a cannon that was attached to truck, into a net in the middle of the MIDWAY. WOW what a sight !!! Living so close to ROCKY POINT, at  ROCKY BEACH  was the best. Linda and I would walk to work, and home every day and night not caring how late it was, we would walk through a path at the end of the parking lot near the batting range, right into her back yard. My father Al Stephen was the caretaker of Rocky Beach, he loved it so much there, as did my mom, Rita. I can not believe that it is gone now. How could the city let this happen to a most beautiful area in the entire state. These memories are instilled in my heart , and will be forever. LONG LIVE ROCKY POINT PARK. I SURE WILL MISS YOU. '

My mother left my brother and I in the car as she was going to be right out, well i began to play with the push button shift. It was an old Valiant. Well i pushed the button marked ( N ) the car rolled backwards and towards the midway it stopped after hitting a fire hydrant. Water was every where my godfather John Ferla his brother Conrad and Vincent all rushed there two find two soaking little boys. as i got older 6 or 7 i used to love going with my godfather to work. I would sit in his car as he would do his rounds. In 1976 I began working there in the maint. dept. Everything i learned there came from my godfather John and his nephew Alan Ferla, who to me was an older brother. I remember how Alan and i used to love playing jokes on his brother Conrad. I also remember one particurlar joke Alan and I loved. We would drop some really smelly liquid, it smelled like rotton eggs and as people would walk by and smelled it we would laugh at there reaction. As a kid in those days i never thought Rocky Point would ever shut down. I wish Vincent Ferla never sold it.'

I was an English student at the park working as a Foods Supervisor for the summers of 1989 and 1990.


I stayed in the big scary (and we thought haunted) house for the first year, just outside the park, and the boys were in beach houses just across the car park. The second year I lived above the main office‚Ä¶ my room was kitted out with an oven, microwave and really was a home from home! I remember Nancy LaVoie, Pat Costello and Jerry who were also supervisors. Cheryl used to work in the office‚Ä¶ everyone was great to us students!


We were treated like royalty... mainly because of our accents &ndash; and most of us spoke the best english ever whilst we were there!


I remember the night when Sam Fox played‚Ä¶ we all cringed‚Ä¶ she was a nightmare from home‚Ä¶ but really big over there then‚Ä¶ Guns and Roses also came and quite a few big acts &ndash; we always wanted to work on the beer carts on the nights when there was a band playing as you could make a fortune in tips‚Ä¶ although I think again a lot of that was due to the accent!


I remember we all used to go to TeDens the bar at the end of the road after work, and it was brilliant‚Ä¶ the parties in the dorms were fantastic and I have so many photos and happy memories of when we all worked there.

In those days it was fine to hitch a lift, and I remember quite a few times we got lifts to Stop and Shop for supplies!


Working the ice cream stand was brilliant &ndash; and depending on who served you you‚Äôd get a tiny cone or some great massive ice cream covered in jimmys!


Ben and Jerrys also had a stand there in 1990, I used to go with Pun Pandya and open the gazebo and we‚Äôd have ice cream for breakfast &ndash; it was just being launched then‚Ä¶ I remember going to Newport and seeing it in a shop there and at the time we thought that was pretty amazing‚Ä¶ now Ben and Jerrys is everywhere &ndash; you can get it in every supermarket over here now‚Ä¶ and it always reminds me of RPP!


They were great times, doughboys, chowder and clam cakes, salt water taffy, sloppy joes in the canteen‚Ä¶ all these things were new and fab for us! Years later I was in New York and drove to RI to visit RPP‚Ä¶ only to find it had closed down‚Ä¶ it was so sad‚Ä¶ Amazing memories‚Ä¶ fantastic photos and great friendships!'

I remember my WORST memory of Rocky point was back in the mid seventies. My mom was a school bus driver for Smithfield, and there was a class field trip for either the junior or senior high school students. My little sister and I had to go along. We spent the whole day OUTSIDE the park, because my mom didn‚Äôt want to take us in (probably because we was po‚Äô folk back then). Yup, the WHOLE day, outside in the parking area, watching the rides. It was then that I truly understood the concept of Purgatory.


My first job was at Rocky Point, in the Ice Cream stand. I was working there when one of the managers tried to burn it down in the &lsquo;80s. I loved the House of Horrors, and we used to get out of the cars and walk around scaring people. I can still smell the clam cakes in the Shore Dinner hall.


The people of RI deserve to have that spot preserved for future generations to enjoy with their families. It would make a great waterfront park for picnics and family get togethers. We all know what will actually happen, though, don‚Äôt we? Well connected cronies will get theri claws into it, and it will be lost forever to us. To add insult to injury, they will probably get State money somehow to do it. So sad.'

I believe it was the second party thrown there. The rave was called CAMP EARTH and people were there from all over the world because it was an amusement park rave,something virtually unheard of. There were a little over 18,000 people there. The very best house,trance,breakbeat,jungle,and happy hardcore d.j‚Äôs were there, from around the globe. The rides ran all night and the wind jammer and the paladium jumped all night until about 12:00 pm the next day. Prior to that I used to pedal my bike from Providence just to get there. My favorite ride was the corkscrew rollercoaster. It‚Äôs very sad to know that a place with such a intense vibe is no more, but Its effect on me and the memories will live on.   '

All we had to do to get to the park was walk through a path in some tall grass. We went to the pool and park on a daily basis. We would search the parking lot for admission bracelets and slip them on. One summer the park just started giving us free admission. I remember being so disappointed when the pool closed. The cottages and park were a great place to grow up and I am very sad to see them go. My kids will not have a chance to be the 5th generation to grow up there. I wanted to do something my own style to remember Rocky Point so I wrote a horror movie and started to film a little around the cottages but it was a late idea the last summer we were allowed there and I ran out of time. I will miss Rocky Point like I miss my great grandmother and wish my kids could have enjoyed both. '

Thats when my life changed . I worked not only at kiddyland but also had the chance to run the house of horror, ..jungle land.. the car that you actually drove, that was fun... the cars would run out of gas or the engine would stop and one of us had to run to the other side to get it started or end up pussing it back to the guarge area.. Then i ran the Roto Jet ( which was located on top of ona concession stand. . In fact while i was reading some of these letters that the people wrote i reconize some of the old timers . Carol Strang ...if you read this i just want to say hello. You were describing the house you lived in and it does bring back memories. The night we all would close down our rides and head to oakland beach . We were called the twin eagles because a lot of us had motorcycles . We had a special table that we sat at.. Yea...old memories....Beach parties and girls. John Ferla would walk around the park checking on us and every once in a while he would yell and say ( in italian accent) ...Fuster boy Fuster. I grow up really having a lot of respect for that man. Then there was the times that his brother Conrad would drive thru the pakk with his big RED caddy and that plate will always be in my mind. RPP ! . Joe carusso (the maintaince man went around the park from earley morning till the park closed repairing the rides. When the power went out in the park we had to react fast to stop our rides in a safe manner and get the people off, Then i would go over to the ferris wheel and help the operator there. The wheel couldn‚Äôt turn so while he worked the cluth i would climb the outside of the wheel and turn the wheel . so many memorise and not to mention my first really love...who i lost because i was young and stupid but i still think of her after 40 years.

Didn‚Äôt get to bring my son there for he was too little to go on anything before they closed the park down. I loved the Corkscrew, Tilt a Whirl, Music Express, a d the Rock N Roll. Those are classic rides. The House of Horrors was funny just to go through. Those were the days. Unfortunately, this state doesn‚Äôt have anything else. You have to travel to surrounding states to an amusement park. Weird Al Yankovic played at RPP years ago, along with Stevie B. The Flume was one of the best rides there on a hot summer‚Äôs day.

We would time the cars so one of us was in a car above pouring a sheet of water in front of an unsuspecting car. There was no way out.

We got stuck at the top and my Dad couldn‚Äôt stop the box from spinning and I was screaming and they couldn‚Äôt get the ride moving again for like 10 minutes, it was so scary, but I also remember thinking how strong my Dad was and how much he loved me trying to keep us safe.

A few years went by and as a graduating 8th grader, my middle school took us on a field trip to RP.

After that, my trips to RP were less with my parents and more with friends. A few trips, here and there, every year. But it was in 1983 that RP became an important summer ritual. I spent EVERY weekend at RP. Sometimes on Saturday, sometimes only Sunday, but for the better part of the summer, it was the whole weekend. I remember the Fixx playing one night. A particularly favorite band of mine at the time. As the years went by, you could see how they weren‚Äôt managing the place properly. One year, it was free admission and you payed for your tickets at the kiosks. The next it was charging admission just to get it. The next it was free admission again, but the ticket prices were comparibly outrageous. At the same time, you never knew what rides would be there from one year to the next. I was fortunate, however, to get my two boys to the park the year it closed. One more time of enjoying ‚Äúa place for family fuuuuuuuun‚Ä¶‚Äù I took many pictures of that final summer. I‚Äôve not been back since it was closed. (Too afraid of being caught trespassing). But from what I‚Äôve seen here, maybe i‚Äôll walk down there one more time, even if there‚Äôs nothing left. It doesn‚Äôt matter. As many of us can attest, if I stand there, among the weeds, cracks, debris, graffitti, and bits and pieces of our past, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll still hear the sound of the Music Express, the girlish screams coming from the Rock-N-Roll, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be a lingering smell of dust, diesel, popcorn and sea air. Maybe I won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôll remember it.'

I have very fond memories of the entire park, but especially the salt water swimming pool which I visited frequently, dinners with the family at the Shore Dining Hall and ‚Äúpigging out‚Äù on the awesome clam chowder and clam cakes, and WVMHS Junior Prom (class of 62) at the Pallidium. I haven‚Äôt lived in RI since 1962 but I knew that the park had been closed. I had no idea of what it now looked like until I viewed some current videos and photos. How sad to see what has become of this once fun family park.'

  content: 'Reading what the other have written and the photos of what has happened to ‚ÄúROCKY POINT PARK‚Äù a very special place for quite a few years of my life brings a tear to my eye and memories of those years come flooding back. My earlist recolection of the park goes back to the 1960‚Äôs as it was considered a amusement park for grownups or more appropiatley kids who considered themselves grownups LOL as we felt that we had outgrown &quot;CRESCENT PARK&quot;.From the flume to the roller coaster it was all very new to us. Then in 1975 I got my first job there working the &quot;SKOOTER&quot;with a friend as we took turns switching sides alternating from taking the riders tickets to being the guy who showed them the way out after the ride ended and untangling the cars that were stuck in positions that the operator could not get out of themselves. Then in 1976 I was operating the &quot;HOUSE OF HORRORS&quot; when as per ususal there was a rock concert on the old midway stage next to the &quot;ROCKY GAME/GIFT, SOUIVNER SHOP&quot; and a unheard of band from austraila AC/DC was playing that night. Most of us know the band nowdays because of the onstage antics of the lead guitarist &quot;ANGUS THE SCHOOLBOY YOUNG&quot; and it was a rather dead night on the rides as most of the people there were watching the concert. I took the 1977 season off due to a better offer from another job but in 1978 I was right back there operating the &quot;ROUNDUP&quot; and the &quot;ROCK AND ROLL&quot; rides but a lot of us could see the writing on the wall as often we would go hours between riders and even the game operaters noticed a decline in buisness even on traditionaly busy friday nights and weekends. Then as summers went along we heard about the &quot;CORKSCREW-LOOP&quot; ROLLER COASTER being built and they were going to add a proper stage for concerts on the midway near the &quot;FLUMES&quot; BIG DROP HILL and that we were going to get a &quot;FREEFALL&quot;RIDE. But even with all the new attractions including a &quot;ROCK &amp;ROLL REVIVAL SHOW&quot; with legends of rock and roll &quot;THE TOKENS&quot; the &quot;SPIRAL STAIRCASE&quot; and even &quot;TINY TIM&quot; performing the crowds returned for a while but as quickly that they returned they were gone and rumors started being spread that layoffs would be happening and that the park was having problems paying its bills. So I started looking for a more stable job and I never worked their again. Then the news about the park closing it‚Äôs doors for good confirmed all that we had heard.And then the fires and vandalism that has stricken the park just tears another peice of my heart off along with the news that the idea that housing would be built at the site of the park is in limbo make my pain a little worse.I was against tearing the remaining buildings of the park down but after seeing pictures taken recently I feel that even though a lot of rhode islands residents have very fond memories of &quot;ROCKY POINT PARK&quot; we ther they worked there or just enjoyed a day or weekend there It‚Äôs time to close the book on this part of rhode island history and finish the job that MINDLESS, THOUGHTLESS VANDALS have started. thank you very much.'

But today I did a quick search and found this website. It brought back many fond memories of the two summers I worked at the park. My friend, Christian, and I lived above the main office building. We were in charge of distributing tickets, collecting cash and bringing change to all of the ticket booths in the park. It was by far the best summer job I had. We each had a Yamaha Razzee scooter that we would whip around the park in doing our collections and deliveries. Sometimes we would take the scooters ‚Äúoff-road‚Äù over to the Rocky Village area (I forget the correct name) or bomb around the park when it was empty. Super fun times. I especially enjoyed ‚Äúteaching‚Äù the lucky (or unlucky, depending how you look at it) kids sitting next to me on the Freefall how to push up on the safety bar a bit and lift your feet during to freefall to get a better sense of falling. Everyone that worked there were great people, I forget some names now, but David, Angelo, Jimmy, the office gang and everyone else were incredibly friendly people. Thanks for the quick trip down memory lane.'

One of my favorite booths was the dog racing booth; I spent hours there and remember the man who ran it had a cocker spanial who sat ther taking everything in.


When I got older and drove myself again it was a fovorite place to go with my friends in tow. I miss Rocky Point and am sorry for what is happening to one of the most wonderful places on earth. At least I have my childhood memories of family outings to remember.

Although I am a boat owner, there is nothing more enjoyable than being able to take a walk and sit by the sea. In the early 80‚Äôs I would scuba dive there for clams with my buddy, whose dad was the president of the park. The amount of shellfish along the shores in 3 - 5 feet of water was staggering. I can remember one day diving under the dock for little necks. I think i got about 600 lbs of clams in a couple of hours. More memorable were the artifacts that I collected that day underwater. I still have the silverware and the plates from the old shore dinner hall. I also found everything from thousands of AK47 bullets in clips, to gold chains, telephones, a mortorcycle, coins, even a visa gold card. I believe the DEM would dump confiscated shellfish at the end of the dock. Lucky for me I hit the mother load. Now that I have children, it seems shamefull that good old Linc Chaffee allowed this gem of the sea to go to private hands. Seems like there is no regard for tradition in this date. Rocky Point, Brenton Tower, Crescent Park, whats next??


Today the main building burned to the ground. It was scheduled to be demolished at the end of this month. Pretty coincidental eh? '

I used to frequent the saltwater pool as a kid in the early seventies with some friends during school summer vacation. My mom and dad used to take me and a friend or two about five times every summer and I took a girl there on a date in 1983. I‚Äôd been there after that date but as I got older I went much less. In fact my memories are only from my very young years. As a child I cherished that place. In July 2003 my friend and I squeezed through a hole in the fence to get one last look, take pictures and in some way to say goodbye. I have those pictures we took but they are quite sad to look at. Thank you to the people who put this site together. Great memories revived.'

I was petrified of some of the rides there, especially the Free Fall. I remember my sister was in the Woonsocket High School band, and they played for President Bush when he was there and all I wanted to do was go explore the park. It was so much fun! The last time I went there was with the Boys &amp; Girls Club in 1995 and it was pretty dead, so all the lines were very short. I took it upon myself to finally ride some of the rides I hadn‚Äôt had the courage to ride earlier (though I never did ride the Free Fall). Of all the places I looked forward to going during the summer, this topped the list.


The ride I think was the most fun was the one where your body was only held in by centrifical force. It started spinning on the ground, and eventually would tilt completely vertical like a ferris wheel. I‚Äôve never seen a ride to this day that operated like that one ‚Äî at least not one that inverted like that. I miss Rocky Point so much!'

The years i cannot remember. But my mom was one of the original cooks in the old shore dinner hall right on the water! My dad worked there also but i dont remember what exactly he did. We lived many places in Rhode Island. But the one place i remember the most is right on Palmer Ave around the corner from the back gate. Cursey‚Äôs bar was just about in our back yard. As a matter of fact it was in our back yard! My mom and i and my sister and step dad lived in a 2 story house. it sat right next to another 2 story house. We were right across from Rocky Beach. This might jog a few memories too. We had a big garden and at one point we opened a vegetable stand and grew and sold our own stuff. What we did not grow, we would go into providence to the farmers market and buy stuff there to sell! Ring a bell yet? Well it had been years sense my mom and real dad had worked there. But when i got old enough i went to see John and Conrad Ferla and they gave me a job in the ticket booths. What a blast i had. I even met my first sweetheart or 2 there also!. I espicially remember one in particular! I loved my job there! But before i was old enough to work i remember going there and hanging out and i used to get alot of free rides. I got to know alot of people. I used to go ice skating in the winter on the small pond behind the pool. Of course i used to swimn in the pool too. Gosh there is so much to remember. Seeing as i lived on Palmer ave till i left home at the age of 20 to get married i had alot of time in Rocky Point. I remember the big old house on the hill also where a certain family lived. I remember the girl named Mary who my sister hung around with and i believe i hung with Marys sister! i have over 20 something years of memories. I did manage to bring my first born child there, just before they closed. my mom still lived on palmer ave at that time. I still talk to some friends of mine who lived in the other 2 stoory house next door. We have remained long distance friends over the years. They are also a part of Rocky Points past. It was funny after the park would close a whole bunch of us workers and friends from Rocky Point would head to Oakland beach for Guss‚Äôs greasy hamburgers. That place is another story. Long live Oakland Beach! I could probably write a book of memories of these places. They were the best years of my life. Now i have been married to the same guy for 35 yrs and we have 3 beautiful girls 2 of which are married. The youngest just turned 18. We also have 4 beautiful grandchildren. ages are, 2 boys are 9 and 9. Two girls are 13 and one is brand new = 2 months. I wish rocky Point was still open so i could bring them there for a good ole fashioned outing. My moms house still stands and i visit RI every couple of years. I now reside in pensacola florida.with my family. Oh yes my brother who passed away last yr also had some memories of rocky point. My sister too, but not as many memories as me! Oh yes the blue danube bar right outside the gate is where my sister had her wedding reception! our mom catered the event. My mom was also a caterar and alos owned the cozy coorner restaurant in warwick with my dad. Anyway THOSE WERE THE DAYS! just some actually. '

My brother Robbie‚Äôs first job was cleaning up after the elephant act. My brother Gary‚Äôs first job was at the salt water pool. When i was 10 I babysat for the palm reader‚Äôs four year old son for a week or so. She paid me off in ride tickets. The first thing we would do is go on the Tilt - A - whirl because the centrifugal force as the ride sped around would force change out of people‚Äôs pockets. We would reach down behind the seats and collect the money. Then we would go to the candy store at Rocky Beach, the summer colony right outside of the park property.

Theres a flash from the way back machine. Rocky point was a great place to work as a kid. I was 14 working in the shore dinner hall, started with dishes and wound up doing just about any thjing else they wanted you to do. I worked for the father Conrad who gave me the job because my two brothers before me worked there. and if they left a with a good work record thats all you needed. of course you had no identity except for your last brothers first name. Thats the way it was then. The days were long, some times 10 hrs and if there was something going on at the jammer you got a little more. Everybody was part of the big familiy.esp in the kitchen where Big John ran most things and Old Manny made the chower every day what a process that was. I used to help but just by bringing the the things he needed . Like 10 gal of potatoes 5 gals of clams and so on. Also Jack was another cook who was in charge he mostly worked on the clam cakes and parties. We had some big parties Try serving 2000 Teamsters over they‚Äôre week end. alot of watermelon. Thank god for billy rizzo this kid could cut melon like a machine and just as acurate.

to 1974 to make money for URI. I could net over $1000 a summer and URI‚Äôs  tuition was $565! I remember Mark Thompson mentioned above. The Ferlas  ran the park and a number of semi-and formerly famous attractions were  brought in - Frank Sinatra Jr., Sly and the Family Stone, the Flying  Wallendas, Marlo Thomas, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, etc.


MRB Enterprises was the company that ran games and was named after three people from Hershey PA: Mel, Ronnie and Beatrice ‚Äî real low lifes! Jerry DiCapua, the son-in-law of Mrs. Leake ran all the games and employed his three kids, Jerry Jr., Brian and Angela there too. His faher-in-law ran ROCKY , the bingo place.


But I had a great time those summers where I worked all the games but took over running the Greyhound Racing game where I made a lot of money working lots of hours (92/week) for college. I can remember collecting over $5000 in quarters on one of the big days (July4th, Labor Day)! I can still remember all the dogs names after 32 years! (Big Wig, Mike Ike, Stacey, Hacker, Shifty, Maglass, Regain, Elect, Hurry Ivan, Tivoli, Bill Me, etc.) My three brothers worked with me (Eddie and Neil worked concessions and Mike ran the Cliff House) and I met and started dating Liz Burke, a sister of one of the guys I knew who ran the Break-A-Dish stand, Kevin Burke. After hours we would all go to the Cliff House where the band, the Coachmen played and drank underage (Mike was the bartender). Liz once turned down an invitation from Gary Puckett to go on the rides with him!


One last note about the Break-A-Dish stand ‚Äî you didn‚Äôt want to work ther on the day you had to shovel out all the broken dishes! They weighed a ton! Funny thing is that RP taught me how to speak in front of people and here years later I often speak before large audiences without giving it a second thought about being nervous! Guess calling greyhound races and guessing peoples‚Äô ages and weights on that hot midway with a scale and a microphone paid off!

  content: 'I first came to Rocky Point on summer Friday nights during the 1960s. The Providence Evening Bulletin ‚Äî no one I knew read the morning Journal ‚Äî had these little ads for the park squeezed in among the movie ads. ‚ÄúRide all the rides ‚Äî $1 ‚Äî 6 p.m. to closing.‚Äù Even my cheap old man knew a bargin when he saw one.


So several times my parents, my three brothers and I would pile into the ‚Äô63 Chevy and drive the 10 miles from East Greenwich. We loved the Dodgems and the Skyliner, and yes ‚Äî more than once we jumped from the ride at its summit and walked back to the midway like 20th Century Huckleberry Finns. I‚Äôll never forget as we left one night, my Dad complaining: ‚ÄúThat evening cost us $22!‚Äù Guess they got us on the food!


We never were allowed to play the games, which is why I guess I was intrigued in the spring of 1971 when a buddy called me over to his table at the high school library. He was reading the want ads in the paper, and pointed to one looking for kids to work the games at Rocky Point. ‚ÄúMRB Enterprises‚Äù was the name of the employer ‚Äî by then the rides, games and food stands were all run by different corporations

it was the beginning of the end.


But I didn‚Äôt know it, and spent five glorious summers at the park working the games. My first summer I earned a princely $1.60 an hour. While there was no overtime, working 80 hours a week could bring a kid a fairly fat paycheck. The job could definitely be a grind ‚Äî especially when it was 90 degrees or more in those booths facing west into the setting sun. It was worse at the ‚ÄúBreak-a-Plate‚Äù ‚Äî break, chip or crack any two plates with one 50-cent baseball throw ‚Äî because of all the dust. There was usually one 20-minute break a day. But once a week a bunch of us would go out for dinner after the park closed to Gregg‚Äôs, Gantry‚Äôs, Arthur Treachers‚Ä¶ those were really fun times.


I met my wife-to-be, Diane, who worked with Mrs. Leake ‚Äî everybody called her Gram ‚Äî where you turned in the coupons you had won at Skeeball and other games for amazingly lousy prizes. I didn‚Äôt fall in love with her until I learned her Dad, Jack Gould, had actually built the Castle of Terror (sometimes known as the House of Horrors) and the Wildcat. That kinda sealed the deal for this midway maven.


We‚Äôve been blessed with two sons, and were lucky enough to be able to take them to Rocky Point before it closed. Every time and place has a time and place that defines growing up, and for many of us there and then, in post World War II Rhode Island, that place was Rocky Point.'

  content: 'I worked at Rocky Point in the late 70‚Äôs for 2 years at the ages of 18 &amp; 19 as the Ferris Wheel Operator. I recall the manager‚Äôs name as Dave. I don‚Äôt recall his last name. His assistant‚Äôs name was Al. As a child in the 60‚Äôs, my grandparents and parents would bring us to Rocky Point once a summer. I remember a ride called The Tea Cups. I also recall the Funhouse and that I was always afraid to ride it. Through the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs I would visit the park at least once a year and I witnesses many changes including new rides and also a change in the crowd. In my early years at the park it was a family oriented park but as the years progressed, the park became a hang-out for teens. The Friday and saturday night rock concerts didn‚Äôt help. I also recall some of the Midway shows including a human Cannonball and also a high wire act.


At the time I worked at Rocky Point, a bar called Cursy‚Äôs was open just outside the exit road. Co-workers and I would gather there after work for a drink and a game of pinball (an old Star Trek machine) or, we would drive over to the old semenary on Warwick Neck Ave. and sit at the stone wall looking over the bay.


I no longer see any of the people I met during that time but I recall some names. Tim and Bill were entrance booth guards and Rick was the train engineer. The ‚Äúfloater‚Äù who made the rounds to all the rides and provided 15 minute breaks to the operators I can remember well. I don‚Äôt recall his name but he had greased back black hair and in fact, I saw him many years later working at BJ‚Äôs in Coventry at the gasoline booth. I also recall Conrad Ferland. He was the Head Honcho there and I can still picture him driving though the park on a small Moped type motocycle. We all behaved when he was lurking.


As a parent, I took my 2 children to the park on several occassions prior to its closing. My daughter was always a daredevil... even at a young age and wanted to go on all the rides even though when she stood against the wooden cut-out of the boy who said, ‚Äúyou must be as tall as me to ride‚Äù, she didn‚Äôt quite meet the requirement. She would stand on her tippy-toes in a desperate attempt to ride the Corkscrew or Sky-Diver.


After the park sadly closed, we bagan taking our children to The Enchanted Forest in Hopkinton for a few years. I believe that small park in still in operation today. Going there was a sad reminder of the closing of a historical gem... that being Rocky Point Park. It is sadly missed but brings on so many fond memories of days long gone by.'

  content: 'I share alot of memories of RPAP as a visitor as well an 3 year employee of the park from 1989 though 1991.The pay was really crappy no matter how many hours you worked. I was too young at the time to be a ride operator. This saddens me to see the park is gone for good and not even a faint sign of redevelopemnt.


In 1990, after my 16th birthday, I was working the food stand #4 (by the bumper cars) from open to close. I was sent out on my first 45 minute break around 3:30PM that afternoon. I get up to the employee lounge order my lunch and take it out side to enjoy the fresh air and picture perfect day it was. I sit down under the apron when a guy who was a ride op starts talking to me. He mentions to me in our converstion that he heard a rumor a kid who worked in the park rode a bicycle from Providence to the park for work every day. I replied to the guy. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say?‚Äù He said well, that is what they tell me but I‚Äôll tell ya this though, the kid must be in the shape of his life. I chucked under my breath a bit because I was that kid he was refering about. I rode a 10 speed bicycle every year back and forth to work. Was working about 18 - 22 miles a day (pending what year) and I could get to the park faster on the bicycle then a car could taking the highway from Providence. Well, I finished my lunch and go to throw my trash away and walked over to the guy who made the comment about the kid cycling back and forth to work on a bicycle. I looked at him and said, ‚ÄúSo what do you think, you think I can keep this shape the rest of my life?‚Äù He just stopped dead what he was doing and just looked at me. The guy was stunned because of the fact he thought what he heard was a rumor and nothing more. I still had some time left on my break some 30 minutes or so, so I walked away to lay on the hill and grass just to soak up some sun, listen to the cars drive in, the seaguls crow and the ocean crash on the shoreline. Then it was back to the grind at stand #4. Working with me at the park was never a dull moment. I always made it fun to work with me at the park no matter where I was at.


But in the three years I worked there. This is the most vivid and startling memory I can share with everyone. I was shocked to find out I was the talk for the park for two consecutive years but did not know it. My thrid year I would only ride the bike to work if something was wrong with my car. But as for keep the shape I was in back then the rest of my life. Unfortunately, no I did not. For health reasons I could not ride a bicycle again, even to this day. In June of 1993 I moved out of RI to Ohio, and my family told me the news about the park problems in 96. I denied it until my visit of December 2000.


I just started college and I was on a two week break visiting family and friends. I had gone out with a very good girl-friend of mine dancing for the night. But when I got back home, I was too energenic to sleep. So I asked my baby brother if he wanted to go for a ride. Sure he said. We ended up at Oakland Beach just a stones throw from the old park. It was nearing sun up. And I could not resist. I parked my out of state car just off to the left of the main gate on the lawn. We proceeded to take a final look at the park. I needed closure or something. We walk down the entrance drive and the first gate was open where they let the trucks and delivery vehicles in (by the apalo and stand #1). We walk up the midway slowly bearing right all they up to where the Corkscrew used to be. When I saw it had been burnt down I was about to burst into tears seeing all my memories have been demolished. My baby brother saw I was about to break and craked a joke so I wouldn‚Äôt cry. We walked by the train tracks and down to where the Wildcat used to be. I looked over where they used to have concerts and stand #3 (mexican) where all the concerts were held remembering when I met and saw Debbie Gibbson perform my last year there. Then I had to get out of there. All of the memories started overwhelming me. So my baby brother and I headed walked down the rest of park by where the Flume was and exited the park. I‚Äôve never really did get the closeure I was hoping for but it was great seeing her again and knowing although its physical existance was gone Rocky Point Amusement Park would forever live on in those who shared its short lived run.


Yeah, we miss the park. Some of us even wish we could rebuild the park. But all the City/State and SBA care about is the almighty dollar! Values and morals in america don‚Äôt exist anymore. This is what brought the park to close. It is ashame when you think about it.'

  content: 'I was just 21 years old and was the last set of employees to work at the park.  My first ride I ran was the House of Horrors. I really wasn‚Äôt  paying attention to how to run and what to shut off or on. I got alot  of people stuck inside, but they would come walking out because it was  nearly impossible to get lost in that structure. The last acts I remember  seeing as I worked was Peter Frampton (his comeback time) and Weird  Al Yankovich. I also worked on the flume. I used to fall asleep on the  second hill when I was supposed to be seperating the logs so they wouldn‚Äôt  bang into each other as they went down the last big hill. When I was  about 4 or 5 there was a FunHouse, the opposite of the house of Horrors.  I was always scared to go in the Fun House. As I got older they closed  the fun house and made the bottom into a food court. As I was running  the House of Horrors, there was a 8-track tape that we would play in  a loop all day and night. Well there was also another 8-track tape that  the boss said didn‚Äô‚Äôt go for the house of horrors. It was the  8-Track tape for the old FunHouse. I don‚Äôt remember too many people  who remember the Fun House, but when the final day came and we all parted  our way from the park. I took the ONLY RARE COPY of the 8-Track that  went to the rarely seen funhouse that was there at least in the 60‚Äôs  and 70‚Äôs (when I remember it). I still have that 8-track, and  made copys of it in the 8-track format and treasured the origanal, which  I still have and still works. I am now 34 going on 35 but that FunHouse  Tape I love and may not be worth much to people who don‚Äôt remember  it. Every one knew about the House of Horrors, but this tape is one  of my most treasured pieces that would have been lost or destroyed if  I never took it. I found it behind the 8-track player in the house of  horrors and my boss always said that this wasn‚Äôt the tape for  the house of horrors, but another tape from a ride that was once there.  I knew what I had, as soon as I got home I popped it in my old 8-track  player and remember exactly what I remember hearing back when I was  4 or 5. I was always scared of the fun house more than the house of  horrors. But I tell ya, even though I was 21 when the park closed, I  was always scared to walk through the house of horrors. That house of  horrors must have went through at least 4 changes that I can remember  since I was a child. Rocky Point was the biggest part of my childhood  growing up in the 70‚Äôs and being born in 71. Fireworks, Clamcakes,  Fries, Chowder, and DoughBoy. My favorate game was always the BB Gun  Range where you had to shoot out the star from the card. I never won,  but it was awesome. And they moved the skyrockets above that game shed.  Anyone remember the rumor about the kids who jumped off the skyliner  where it turned around at the rock cliff? That was a good old story  for a while!!'

Later on, as teenagers, my sister, cousin and I went to RP on our own during another visit to CT. This time, we bought some of those exquisite clamcakes to take back home. My cousin set the paper bag of cakes on top of her car while unlocking the door, and a seagull swooped down and grabbed the bag! We were stunned, but Kathy fought that darned bird ‚Äî and won.


After I met my now husband, originally from Providence, we went to RP once and it rained so bad the rides were shut down. We got our picture taken in one of those booths. I still have the pics. We were soaked, but had a great time.


By the time our first daughter was born (1997) and we were living in Providence (1998), RP had been closed and was in decline. For Halloween of 1998, the House of Horrors was open just for fun, so we went; mainly for the nostalgia.


Another memory I have of RP was riding the Rock N Roll with my cousin (the seagull fighter) and her dad. The seat belts didn‚Äôt work properly on the ride, and I almost fell out. I never went on that ride again.


Now I live in Western Washington. There‚Äôs an amusement park here called Wild Waves &amp; Enchanted Village. It used to be independently owned, but sold out to Six Flags a few years ago. The first time we went, I saw this huge red and white roller coaster that looked vaguely familiar. Later on, I found out it was the Corkscrew from RP! The next time we went to Wild Waves, the Corkscrew was painted this ugly green color, and it‚Äôs new name is The Wild Thing.

My father would drive from his work  in Walpole Mass. to RP just to get us the red and white chowders and  the best damn clamcakes in the world. I would ride the cyclone over  and over , the flume we would save for last cause in the front we would  get soaked. My sister used to cry when I would make her ride the house  of horrors with me . In 1995 I moved to Los Angeles , when I found out  they closed RP I must have cried for a week. I never looked at another  amusment park the same again. I will always hold RP in my memories,  too bad my kids can‚Äôt experiance the same happiness I did. I LOVE  ROCKY POINT'

The next summer I worked  in the Fudge Kitchen which was across from the carousel. I worked at  the Fudge Kitchen for 5 summers in a row. The first few years I worked  at Rocky Point the crowds were large and business was brisk. My last  few years there the crowds thinned and began to change from mostly families  with kids to teenagers. In an effort to bring in more business the management  sponsored late night raves and Greatful Dead cover bands. It was sad  to witness Rocky Point‚Äôs decline. Working at the Fudge Kitchen  with all of my friends (mostly from Warwick Vets) was by far the most  fun I have had at any job. I have such fond memories of Rocky Point.  It still feels unreal that it is gone.'

Then it was off to the dining hall for chowder  and clamcakes then finishing it all off with, if I remember right watermelon.  Next were the rides, my fondest memory had to be my sister and I along  with my grandmother in the Scrambler, we all laughed so hard as she  was trying to keep from ‚Äúsquishing‚Äù us as the ride went  from side to side. Now that I look back on it she had to be in her 60‚Äôs  when she went on these rides, dang I miss her so much she was the coolest!  Another time my sister and I were on the gondola ride above the minature  golfcourse and we both made the mistake of dropping things on the players  below and when we got back to the landing the attendant wanted to take  us both back to the office but as you can imagine my grandmother would  have no part of that! I went back there once I think about 1997 and  it was closed,very depressing to me to see Rocky Point in the state  i found it because I had not known it had been closed. I will never  return to that area again but will forever have the best memories of  RP and my grandmother as long as I live. Thank you all for posting pictures!'

It was the best  anyone could have wanted back in those days‚Ä¶ We would fall asleep  to the sounds of the rides and the people and the music and the sounds  of the bats hitting the balls from the batting cages (when it was there).When  I got older, I would walk the path over to the park and get my share  of skee ball and riding the cyclone over and over and over again. I  would ride the Enterprise and the Skydiver and be afraid of the YoYo  ever since one summer it toppled over and was out of commission for  a while. The house of horrors is still one of the scariest rides I can  remember. Those were the times of my life‚Ä¶ eating clam cakes on  the dock and getting the coupons for the ride all day bracelets (Almacs  usually had it them)‚Ä¶ remember when they were metal clasps with  colored string and kids in the parking lot would beg you for yours when  you left for the day?

About 17 or so years ago, my Aunt and Uncle  bought a cottage at Rocky Beach and we spent many summers sitting in  her yard enjoying the atmosphere that the Park brought us. After spending  our summers at my Aunt and Uncle‚Äôs House, my parents then bought  their own cottage at Rocky Beach about 4-5 years ago. This is where  they still spend their summers. We‚Äôve celebrated all of our summer  birthdays and holidays at ‚Äúthe cottage‚Äù since there is no  where else we wanted to be. Most of our childhood, teenage, and adult  memories originated from our experiences and celebrations at the Rocky  Point Amusement Park and at the cottages at Rocky Beach. Now‚Ä¶  after so many people cried the day they closed, the land is sold to  high corporate businesses and they are taking it all away from us to  make millions of dollars.

One time Saint Raymonds school had an outing in the fall. It was raining and most of the rides were shut down for the season. One or 2 classmates figured out how to start the dodge‚Äôems (I never knew they were called ‚ÄúSkooter‚Äù). We rode around for FREE for at least a half hour before Sister Cathlene came looking for us. She walked around for awhile before her conscience got the better of her and made us quit.


I live on the West Coast now and you couldn‚Äôt find a Clam Cake with a magnifying glass. The only thing remotely close to those things is an amusement park in Santa Cruz, Ca. It has an old wooden Roller Coaster like Crescent Park.'

I was 3 when we first started to go. In my eyes I was Rocky Point‚Äôs favorite little girl that came to visit them. I only thought that way because when I was 4 years old they let me ride the Corkscrew. Well, that is because my mom signed an agreement that if I died on the ride or fell off it wasn‚Äôt their fault and she couldn‚Äôt sue them and that I always had to ride with an adult. I rode that coaster like there was no tomorrow. I also remember that when I‚Äôd ride the Cyclone with family members that they couldn‚Äôt stay on as long as I could. That still amuses me to this day. By the time I was either 6 or 7 Rocky Point was having financial problems. We went once when they switched owners and we didn‚Äôt stay there for more than 15mins. It was terrible. Then sortly after all that they shut it down. That place was my favorite childhood memory. I don‚Äôt care if it was a scuzzy looking place. It was my favorite scuzzy looking place!

Try getting cotton candy to stick to a cone in 100% humidity!‚Äù I vividly remember coming home completly sugar coated after working all day.


I have a few theories on why Rocky Point is no longer. One in particular is the popularity of the television. More and more people were staying home on summer nights. Another reason is security. Toward the end it got worse and worse, with the fights every night and gangs of youth that showed up. This pushed the families away.


Also, Rocky Point also had a huge employee theft problem. Their employees would rip them off, big time! Everything was CASH! I believe they paid the ‚Äúgame of chance‚Äù employees next to nothing because they KNEW they would pocket money for themselves.


And finally, the park was simply, and sadly out of date. How could RP compete with places like Six flags. It would‚Äôve taken an enormous amount of money to give the park what it needed and nobody would put up that kind of money for a park located in a residential neighborhood, with no easy highway access. RP just wouldn‚Äôt work if it were reopened today.


RP used to bring people from around the world to work the summer. People as far away as Indonesia! (Two smoking hot girls from Scotland come to mind) I miss all of them, and the good times at RP.'

That was the last thing he wanted to do after a day in a sweaty jewelry shop, but he did it anyway. After an exhilerating ride on the Whip, my next stop was the Penny Arcade. The Gypsy grandmother would whir out a fortune card for me; and I would never miss putting my penny in the little machine where you looked into an ornate viewer and turned a little handle which rapidly flipped the many photo cards inside, making an animation happen before your eyes! I‚Äôd buy a little cellophane Kewpie doll on a stick, with feathers and sparkles, or a colorful paper parasol. Topping the night off with those fantastic clam cakes, I would go to bed a happy child. If only I could travel int ime, to see those wonderful buildings and rides with new eyes, and appreciate the art form they were.

My entire family would stand in line to get some ‚Äúcakes and chowder‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt even like clams in those days but the cakes were too good to resist. I particularly liked throwing the clam cakes from the dock as high into the air as possible and watch the sea gulls gobble them in mid air.

  content: 'The park was wiped out in the 38 hurricane and remained dormant for 10 years. It came under the control of Vincent Ferla, among others, and Vincent screwed his partners out of their share. Vincent had two brothers, Corado and John. My Dad owned a bar at 45 Atwells Ave. which he had to sell to his younger brother Pete in 1948 upon the death of their mother. My Dad borrowed $5000 from his sister Lena and brought a ride to the 1948 Rocky Point called the Spitfire (see photo). My Dad‚Äôs on the right. The Penny arcade is in the background. It was owned by Louie Mazza from Bridgeport, CT. Louie had a brother Mario who stood about 6‚Äô4&quot; ‚Äî huge gentle giant. These are the original Mario brothers.


Anyway, my dad went to the Pokerino one day to change a $20 bill and Jimmy Vogel (Diamond Jim) went with a bushel of bills to change them. At that moment, Dad knew he was in the wrong business with the Spitfire ride.


He sold the Spitfire and constructed the concrete Skee Ball building at the base of the hill across from the Penney Arcade. Dad went to the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and bought 20 alleys ($2000 per alley) with no credit. The owner told my Dad had an honest face and he could pay him when he could. Skee Ball was 5 cents at the time. He waited for Crescent and Lincoln Parks to go to 10 cents for 1 season, and then raised his price. In doing this, he took their customers. The box that collected dimes was beneath the lever you pulled to release a vertical stop that allowed the 9 balls to come down. This box could hold $500 in dimes. On a good Sunday, the Skee Ball could gross $2000. That‚Äôs 20,000 games or 1000 games per machine. That‚Äôs about 80 games per hour for 12 hours.


We‚Äôd be prepping the stands prior to Memorial Day opening and we‚Äôd hear shotgun blasts. A while later, we‚Äôd see the 3 Ferla brothers walking down the midway from the merry go round with their shotguns and dinner; pigeons. Those guys would eat almost anything. Their mother lived in the house on the hill above the SkeeBall. John Ferla and his wife Pina lived with her there. John handled all of the park‚Äôs maintenance issues. Vincent and his wife Carolyn lived over the Cliff House, a lounge on the cliff overlooking the bay. It also incorporated the park office. Conrad Ferla ran the Shore Dinner Hall.


When minimum wage was $1.25/hr my brother in law and I worked the stand one 3rd of July and lost 72 stuffed animals to winners (our most expensive prize was $36/doz wholesale). We grossed a hair over $1000. That was a great day. But the park business was sometimes the most boring place in the world. imagine, 3pm, Wed, July, 100 deg, no one around in the park, the park music permeating everthing, no one but an 8 year-old kid with one dime. You‚Äôve made 40 cents the previous 2 hours since opening. The kid plays his name, Joe, wins, and makes you climb to the top of the stand where the temp is 125 deg to get a 6 foot stuffed goofy looking snake.


My Dad also owned the Skooter (aka Dogde-em, bumper cars) ride. That was a 2 minute ride for 20 cents. It was the only ride in the park not owned by Vincent Ferla, the park owner. It also was the only ride where you exited the ride and then paid. It was also portable. The walls were collapsible. Almost no one knows that. When Ferla refused to give Dad a 5 year lease on his other 15 concession (Skee Ball, Rocky (bingo for prizes) game, fish pond, hoopla, 3 stuffed animal stands (A1 A2 and A3), Blanket stand, doll stand, lamp stand, knock down the cats, cig/candy, basketball ‚Äî he brought in a tractor trailer and began ride disassembly 1 week before the official opening. This would have left a wonderful ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the park. Dad got his lease.


I remember once the concessionaires elected NOT to hire the Beatles for a 3-day engagement for $20K because they felt it was too much money.'

The next day at work, while picking up a broom stick his last words were ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a soldier,‚Äù as he dropped dead. Apparently he had been having a stroke, most likely from alcohol consumption day after day. Is it odd that Narragansett continues to be my favorite beer?

  content: 'It‚Äôs strange how in Rhode Island so much of our history that previous generations once cherished and protected are being destroyed and/or replaced for reasons that are neither sound nor valid. In Europe, they preserve and protect their rich history and pass on their traditions from one generation to the next, but in Rhode Island we have neglected and abandoned what we always claimed to have favored such as the Brewery, the Outlet, Rocky Point, the Shore Dinner Hall, the Warwick Musical Theatre, etc., etc. Of course, the politicians and land developers call this ‚Äúprogress‚Äù. All of these places, however, could have been saved if only the younger generation were as proud, aggressive, business savvy and innovative as their ancestors once were. Yes, we need to get our act together and the politicians need to stop catering to the rich and powerful! Replacing our history and traditions with things like Lowes, Condominiums, and fancy strip malls is not a very good thing for the Ocean State. Very soon we will become a state with few hints of history and tradition. '

  content: 'I moved to the Arlington section of Cranston in the spring of 1990 and one of the first things I noticed was the old brewery. When I got to know the kids in the nieghborhood, we‚Äôd explore the grounds and while walking the tracks that ran along side the brewery and under Cranston St. you could see a visual time line. Many of the buildings that made up the once thriving factory each had it‚Äôs erected date, signifying the difference in time periods. It was really cool to see and ultimetly taken for granted. That summer, we found a way into the old brewery, which was no easy task. We had to litterally climb into an open window that was perched about eight or nine feet from the ground, and once you were up there, you had to wedge your body through the brick interior and the conveyor belt that ran down into a small dark tunnel on your right. On your left you could see a larger opening that lead to a much larger room. It was very creepy (the chipped paint, the smell of mildew etc.) Crates with empty beer bottles still sat on the conveyor belts, Playboy centerfolds lined the locker room walls, all dating back to the mid 60‚Äôs to late 70‚Äôs. It was pretty cool stuff and yes, taken for granted. You could clearly see when the day came and shut down for good, everybody stopped what they were doing and just left. Very creepy but cool none the less. Ounce you made it up and through and over (you had to crawl down the belt to the larger room on your left) you had countless hours of fun and dangerous exploring to accomplish. Not all of the brewery could be explored however. The old catwalk bridge was securly locked so I never got to see the whole brewery. On the other side of the property ( facing Garfield) me and my friend Josh had a small hangout spot under one of the loading docks. He noticed a vent cover under the loading dock and we decided to take a screw driver to it and after several minutes of hard labor, we got the metal cover off. What we found was the ULTIMATE hangout destination. When your a 13 year old kid, this was better than Rocky Point!!!!!!! We‚Äôd go to the NHD ( now abandon!!) on Cranston St. and buy spray paint to decorate the walls inside. Im not to sure the purpose of this room was, it looked like some sort of bomb shelter. It had no windows and was very dark ( even in broad daylight) so a flashlight was always needed. And on the far end (where Gibbs School is located) was this big blue tower that overlooked the whole damn brewery. The view, (and I don‚Äôt mean to be cheesey) was breath taking. I really miss that place and looking at the old photo‚Äôs really brought me back. It was an amazing building providing so much history and adventure. It was all taken for granted. The fire a few years later only caused security to be beefed up, ending any future fun. I consider myself lucky, but pissed!! I thought that place would be there forever (like Rocky Point) at my disposal.'

One night a fan threw a workboot on the floor to protest a bad call. At that time, the court was oriented north-south and so it was really intimate. That was just as the Civic Center was being built. So Brown would play a couple games a year at the Civic Center but most games at Marvel. I was waterboy for two seasons and really loved it, but the team could never win on the road against Penn and Princeton so never even made NIT. Best player I ever saw there: Brian Taylor of Princeton, who went on to play with the Nets. Saw the Penn coach who coached the Pistons to the NBA titles coach there too.

There were massive compressors and huge (asbestos insulated) ducts all over the top floor that chilled air and dropped it to the floors below.

The next floor down had offices and staff areas that looked very 1950s-60s. The neatest place was the employee check-in area. There were wall hooks where floor workers hung their outdoor coats, a counter with numbered cubicles where they checked their pocketbooks or personal effects, and a changing room where they put on their W.T.

  content: 'I‚Äôm not opposed to new buildings, so long as what replaces it can prove that strives for good aesthetics, and well built and its purpose offers has some benefit for the community (i.e housing, offices). But what they want to put there is a open parking lot, in an already very dense area, around the corner from where the city bus station and several underground parking garages are. And this is just for that square mile area! I‚Äôd say we were over adaquetly supplied in that area? Time to divert more attention into renovating old station houses, building new ones, making new bus routes, encouraging more walking, otherwise small seemingly insignifigant buildings such as this will be used to henpeck the city little by little into a giant car yard for Boston, where pedestrians are stopped every 15 feet to wait for a lot patrons to exit. (Which is what I must say, the area around Waterplace Park looks and operates exactly like). People have put up with this too often in other cities, time to make it stop ‚Äì Put up a Fight!'

  content: 'I grew up across the street (on Valley Street ‚Äì the light blue house that appears in a few of the pictures ‚Äì its now painted yellow and the location of the 288 Chinese Restaurant). My family (going back 3 generations) lived there, too, until the last of us moved out in the mid 1980s. I have heard many stories from relatives that when they were growing up ‚Äì they used to play in the complex (disaster waiting to happen). After seeing a mill fire up the other end of Valley Street as a kid, I constantly used to worry that this mill would catch fire, and we would lose our house. Judging by the pictures and the conditions of the mill (and the many mill fires I have seen since), I dont think my fears were off base‚Ä¶ While I am all for preservation of these types of buildings (similar to the work done at both ends of Valley Street) I think there was only so much at that time that could be done, and really, in the end, this was a win-win for the neighborhood. As the visual aspects of the neighborhood look so much better. However, for personal reasons, I am glad they chose to save the Uncas Building (My grandmother, and other relatives worked there for many years). When I drive by, I can still see them (from when I was a kid) waving their hankees/white towels in the window at me, towards our house, as our living room windows faced where they all sat. It was a big thrill as a kid. After my grandmother passed away a few years ago, I drove down Newark street ‚Äì when I got to the corner of Valley street, and I looked up at the top floor of Uncas ‚Äì I saw that same sight (although I realized a few minutes later, it was just workmen) and for just those few seconds, I saw Grandma.'

  content: 'In 1969, I approached Reverend Hemenway at Christ Episcopal Church to teach photography to neighborhood children, and he generously offered to select students and host my classes. After the year and a half of teaching, I moved to Boston when I graduated from RISD and lost touch with the Reverend and the students. If anyone recalls this class and wants to get in touch with me, please do. My first group consisted of six boys, ages 10-13. Two were Alter Boys, Steven Grant and Teddy Wilcox (who I am in touch with today). Also in the photography groups were Ronnie Nance, Michael and Steven Goode, Steven and Norman Baxter. Our groups met at the adjoining Church House in a large room naturally lit by enormous arched windows. In the summer, I moved into a room in the house next door to the church and taught art in their youth program. I recall many of those young girls and boys &mdash; Patty Person and Shirla, Richie Taylor, John Sousa, and Tommy Smith. In total, I have the names of 52 wonderful children who I met during my year teaching and would love to hear from any one of them if they read this note.'

It was located at 917 Manton on the corner with Fruit Hill Ave. Demolished some time in 2005 and now the lot houses a brand new video store. I work across the street at the Stop &amp; Shop and my heart bleeds every time I cross that intersection, but I do get a smile to see that someone further up Fruit Hill Ave has recycled the school‚Äôs wrought iron fencing in their own yard. The loss of this fine church hurts even more than the loss of the school, and the pics of the demo make me cry because it looks like the demo crew wasn‚Äôt too keen on destroying the church either.

I am twenty-five and had been going there literally before I was born. I am very good friends with Mr. Hiyama, one of the two original owners, and he has no intentions to opening a new restaurant. Why? Because it is so hard to find an affordable space, among other reasons. There is now a big hole in the culinary scene in the city of Providence. But I am sure it will be filled with the anticipated hotel that was the cause of the demolition.'

  content: 'Agreed. This proposed building is bland-o-rama. The composite photo (of the Mercantile Block with Hotel on top), looks a little more interesting though and would at least provide a space for the Cuban Revolution and New Japan to stay at. I think that providing accomadations for established businesses is particularly important as most were there when times weren‚Äôt good. They provided the good food, entertainment, and services that helped back up the city‚Äôs ‚ÄúProvidence Renaissance‚Äù campaign in the 90s when people were looking for more evidence of it beyond the hype of the new mall and relocated rivers, as good as they have been. What would be the motivator of an established business to stay or a new business to stay long term if there was always an easy threat of displacement? Why not just take up residence in Cranston, Warwick, Johnston, where that threat would not be easily realized?'

His name was Len Harten (or Leonard Harten) I have a few pictures of him and his team of racers taken on the track at the Cycldrome.

Is there any way that I may be able to track down and actually “see” any of the old programs? I was only two years old when my Mother took me to the races one night. Even at the age of two, I remember it vividly, with the crowds cheering, the sound of the motorcycles that were used in the “pacer” racing.

Interestingly, there was a man who worked there at that time, when we would go there, he would be practicing his accordion in the back. I ran into that man a few times in the last year or so. When I saw him, despite the many years that passed – I recognized him on the spot. I said to him "You used to work at Chips Bowling years ago, right? You used to play the accordion?" He looked at me (I think shocked, seeing how young I was to remember such as thing), and when he said yes, It immediately sent me into (good) flashbacks of my childhood. I really miss this place.

At a certain point in the 1980s Sears made a strange business decision that it would close all the free-standing Sears complexes in the USA. It would only continue to operate the Sears stores that were part of large suburban shopping malls. While many could argue that this saves on marketing, because other stores help bring in the customers, it also appeared to be another anti-urban decision by a large retailer. Even now, Wal-Mart’s approach is to begin thinking about urban areas only when the rural and suburban markets are saturated.


In the mid-1980s, some of my friends bought their first suits at theAndersen Little. The underground bowling alley was open long after the Sears complex closed. The combination of duckpins and the small bowling balls is something that is extremely difficult to find these days. This is a unique aspect of New England culture that has largely disappeared.'

The Sears I worked for was a by-gone era... the department stores that have survived did so by moving into malls and amalgamating their personalities with that of those stores around them.

Anyway, now that they cleaned up the old Automotive, maybe they will do something with the main store. Between that and Anderson Little, it looks pretty bad.

  content: ' “Joann’s Silver Top Diner” was a part of the ”Holy Trinity” of late-night greasy spoons when I was a student at Brown in the early-mid 80s. (The other two were Haven Brothers and The Silver Truck.) Many a time did the Silver Top save me from going to bed drunk and hungry, instead of just drunk. One night, we showed up at about 2 am, in a group of about 10 guys, 10 of whom were wasted and 4 of whom (including myself) still had on costumes and makeup from a goofball fraternity ritual earlier in the evening. (We looked like a cross between the band “Kiss” and Marylin Manson.) After engaging in our usual ritual of debating, in front of the waitress, whether to order large sodas or smalls (both were listed on the menu, but we could never perceive any difference in the size of the glasses), some cops came over to our table, and asked, in a menacing tone, what was up with the costumes. Even AFTER they had explained to us that some costumed ex-con had robbed and pistol whipped a gas station attendant in the neighborhood the night before (it was late October, and Halloween was in full swing), my even-drunker-than-I-was friend started getting all agitated and blurting out “Miranda” this and “4th Amendment” that. I kicked my friend in the shins and calmly explained to the cops that we were just your average drunken college kids doing sophomoric, stupid, but relatively harmless college kid stuff. They let us go, we proceeded to enjoy our foot-long chili cheese dogs, and I ended up becoming a lawyer. I owe it to the Silver Top for discovering that I had it in me.'

Prior to the silver and chrome structure transported from New Jersey in the late 30’s, there was a wooden diner owned by he and his father. My family all worked in it — as I was growing up — it was, indeed, a bustling place for a unique mix of society — there were the produce workers from across the street (where my father purchased fresh produce daily) — I learned to pick the best melons as I accompanied him — factory workers from Brown &amp; Sharpe, Armour meat company, and Executives who enjoyed good home-made food.  I’d worked the busy early-morning shift  (summers- I was still in school) and at 11:00 could sit down for a great breakfast — fresh homemade corn and bran muffins — and the best coffee in town. In those days we had our own baker, a Portugese gentleman, who made fresh homemade pies. Each day the diner had a different lunch special — Thursdays was New England Boiled Dinner and Fridays had delicious Mattahan Clam Chowder. I remember my Dad coming home one morning (having worked all night) and very excited as Louis Armstrong had stopped in the Diner with a bus load of his enterage traveling on Tour. My Dad owned the diner for about 30 years. I always wondered what happened to the gigantic neon sign with yellow top as it was missing AFTER the John Baeder painting. Seeing pictures of the diner is like seeing pictures of the home you grew up in. I spent so much of my childhood there — waiting on customers.'

  content: 'Sad to hear the Silver Top’s moving out of Providence, but glad it has a new home in Pawtucket. Back in my carousing days (the mid to late 90s) the night wasn’t over until I stopped at the Silver Top for a huge breakfast. When the diner hit its peak in the early morning, every stool at the counter was occupied; late arriving friends would squeeze into an already crowded booth. The jukebox would come to life. People would shout orders to the (amazing) wait staff, and they would shout to the cooks. It was very noisy. A line would form at the door. It was always almost chaos. But somehow seats were found for everyone. Your cup was filled with coffee. The kitchen didn’t explode under the pressure, as you almost feared it might, but sent you your food, exactly as you ordered. It was rarely not hot, and always good. Part of the Silver Top’s appeal to me was the oddball clientele someone mentioned above — rockers from Lupos, night-owls, frat boys, gays and drag queens, students, downcity “characters”, and who knows who, or what, else. In my experience everybody got along pretty peaceably. It was only the drunks or the occasional rude customer causing a problem. I forget the name of the Silver Top’s owner at the time but I always admired her skill at running the place, and wished her success keeping the doors open in the teeth of so much upheaval, with Providence Place going up and the old markets adjacent dead or relocated. It couldn’t have been easy. Around then the crowd I ran with decamped to the Seaplane on Allens Avenue, closer to the clubs we went to. We went less and less often to the Silver Top. My days of drinking and clubbing, and big breakfasts, were over.
  

It seems ironic (and ill-omened) that the city that invented diners is in its so-called renaissance uprooting the Silver Top, forcing it to join its sister, the Modern Diner, in Pawtucket. So many of the places that kept the city alive (well, barely) in its Medieval Era, are being pushed out, shut down, moved to the periphery; in the way of the next new, essential parking garage or luxury condo heliport. Well, no good deed ever goes unpunished. If those small shops and alley bars and live music clubs hadn’t stayed behind, making not only noise but money, when every other business pulled up stakes, Providence might still be known as that place you drive through to get to Cape Cod. Cities evolve, like everything else. But I cling to the belief that a city is, above all, an open, not a gated, community, belonging to anyone who wants to work and live in it. After a good early start remaking downcity for everyone’s benefit, now private interests seem in the saddle. What they’ll make of the city remains to be seen, but I doubt the result will be anywhere near as welcoming and open to all as the Silver Top. I think I’ll like the new skyline, though. '

My 90-year old mother’s, uncle, Albert McEachern, was an East Providence artist and, according to his obituary, he painted many murals in homes, churches and other buildings in East Providence, including one in the East Providence Masonic Temple. He also painted a mural in the Second Baptist Church in East Providence in 1939, which was dedicated to his wife, Florence A (Bayers) McEachern. I know that the church is still there, but is now a Russian church. I am planning a trip to Providence in Sept. and would like to know if anyone can help me to determine if there is a Masonic Temple in East Providence that would have been there in the 1930s. Does the name of the artist Albert McEachern mean anything to anyone? He, also, painted murals, with a maritime theme, in may East Side homes.Many thanks. rpearce1 [at] nycap [dot] rr [dot] com'

I grew up in R.I., went to college in Providence and recall this building as being boarded up as long as I lived in the state. Durng my stay at the hotel I invited some old local friends to visit and check out the rennovated place. One acquaintance remembered breaking in about 30 years ago and recounted his observations of the interior just as these photos show it. Lots of graffiti! While downstairs at the restaurant, he called me over to a hall by the door and pointed out a number of large prints of what I saw as abstract art. On closer inspection, I could see that it was all graffiti from the inside of the original structure! I later noticed similar prints throughout the hotel and in the room I was staying in. It looks like the old WAS preserved within the new after all!'

You had to climb up the edges of the stairs, as the metal in the center was either gone or rusted paper thin – I can remember a few of us going knee deep through them. It was such a beautiful building once you got up top into what felt like the bones of an auditorium – the moonlight streaming in through the holes in the roof. An amazing place, and peaceful till you realized that the holes above you corresponded roughly to the piles of concrete debris on the floor all around you. Nothing ever came crashing down while I was in there though. 


There was a creepy building next door at the time that we’d gone into once or twice. Some sort of residence with lots of rooms and twisted hallways. It always felt like you were gonna find a corpse in there – seriously. Made the brave move one night to open one of the refridgerators in there. Unbelievably it was still full of food, though it was long past the point where you could recognize anything that wasn’t labelled. 


Now when I say the place was twisty, I mean that once I got in there I could not find my way out at all. Me and a pal had to heave something through a window on the second floor and scramble down the roof.'

Then climbing up the rickety stairs until we got to the top floor. There is not an inch along the walls not covered in graffiti and the humongous top floor was astounding. We tried out the rope swing that hangs from the skeleton that was once a roof. We had to be careful to only swing from the end with the elevator shafts because if you swing from the opposite, and higher, side you will have too much slack and go crashing to the floor as my friend did. Before you know it, the train tunnel is going to be turned into a 200 room 5-star hotel. RIP temple (the real one at least).'

Boy Pepe did not like to hear this when he came home. We would go to the built-in swimming pool as kids with him and have a blast!  He was a very firm man. He passed away in 1983. Lots of stories of the “bad boys school” but to us growing up it was just a normal place that Pepe worked! Again if anyone has pictures of the home that was where the super lived please e-mail me, I can remember that home and everything about it, inside and out. I just wished I had a picture, I spent so much of my childhood there!!  — Colleen'

In the 80’s I remember going to a haunted house with friends on the property. I got so shackin up going through the maze. I have never been able to go into another haunted house again. I am glad they turned the property into a beautiful area where people can shop, live and work, but whenever I drive by, I still see all those abandoned open dorms with broken windows and wonder what those children went through when they lived there many,many years ago.'

Here, we had an exceptional set of historic institutional buildings, beautifully and solidly constructed, nicely arranged on an attractive piece of land. There were so many possiblities for something truly unique and beautiful to come out of it - something that Cranston desperately needs.

Today I came across this site and was astonished at the bits of information of possible torturing of the children and now bones discovered. I think that due to the possiblity of this place having some sort of terrible past there should be more research regarding the matter before continuing contruction.

My family and I (wife &amp; 5 children) lived in the supt’s house. Our youngest daughter, Jeanne, was christened in the chapel on the grounds by the Catholic priest (forgot his name) whose parish was in W Warwick. Bill Gaulin was the mainstay of the staff of the training school. He and his wife and children lived on Sockanosett Rd in a very old, white house. Bill was not happy when I became supt because I was a liberal and he wasn’t, at least he pretended he wasn’t. I had to go to a meeting in NY one day and called Bill in and told him I was going to be away for 4 days and would he please take care of the kids. He said, “I suppose you want me to give him candy!” I said, “That’s about right.” I knew what he meant and he knew what I meant and from that day on we got along famously.


We had two Picards, father and son, working as Youth Supervisors. They too came from W Warwick as did most of the staff. Old man Picard, as he was know, had a beautiful German Shepard Dog, when she had puppies he gave us one whom we named Princess. She was a part of our family for 14 years, a great dog. Many memories come flooding back- I have a lot of stories to tell-by the way, one more...


I was away one evening giving a speech and there was a little “to-do” with one or two of the boys. Ray Palmer, Sr. Supv now deceased, a great guy, called our house and asked for me. My wife said I was out; he then asked my wife what he should do about the situation. She told him she wasn’t the superintendent and that he should call back around 10 pm and talk to me.


I am very pleased to see the improvements being made to the old training school.'

**Medical Examiner Seeks Help To Identify Bones**, 06-24-2006 3:42 AMs


(Providence, RI) — The state Medical Examiner’s Office has confirmed that bones found in the Garden City section of Cranston are human remains. The bones were found Thursday afternoon by a work crew digging in the area. The ME’s Office says the identification of the bones as being human was made visually by an anthropologist at the University of Maine. The investigation will continue in an attempt to provide further information about the remains. (A.I.R.: It was later determined that the bones originated from a forgotten graveyard on the site.)'

I understand that this building has had a rather bad recent few years with all that “Roger W.” stated below but common sense should tell you that this building is NOT better leveled than rehabbed. If rehabbed properly, the property values around this location would go UP! While some regard this as tax trouble, others regard this as a good investment made better. I have seen these sorts of buildings razed for other plans and the result is always awful! The architect of today is not given the tools to make a building as beautifull as this. This is something that can ONLY be made prior to WWII. I have always said that if a building cannot be made again in the same style without a 9 figure grant, it shouldn’t be torn down! Historic scenery enhances a place. Why more people don’t understand this, is baffeling!? I understand the owners have a business nearby that requires more parking and that is why they want to erase this piece of history and fine example of a bygone era in architecture. Where I come from, we call that squandering and selfish. Pure and simple. Many years ago I tried in vein to do what I could to save the Manton and Fruithill Avenue school but was uncomfortabley way out of my league. It was demolished in 2002 and is now the site of a very unattractive 1 story building. Why anyone would want something like this to happen again is unimaginable. We as a city need to support groups like the preservation society so that landowners like this do not destroy our beautifull landscape one bad idea at a time. I beleive the penalty for this infraction of demo without proper permission is $500 a day. Is this a joke? I knew it would be low but what kind of arrogant land developer wouldn’t ignore this and rip into it if it may cost $500 a day? This is an outrage. The very first thing that should be done is to raise that amount to something that would be quite inconvenient. That cost wouldn’t deter even the poorest of developers.

But, like I said I can’t fault them for wanting to increase the parking in the area since it is tough to come by and especially if they operate businesses on Broadway. But on the flipside, there are a handul of buildings I would love to see demo-ed and turned into parking before we knock down this gem.'

I also think that Federal Hill’s “best interest” is a very subjective issue, and if you’re of the generation that insists on urban renewal, of course you’re going to be a proponent of 3 blocks of surface parking. Do yourself a favor, and take a trip to Savannah, GA, for a long weekend, and see what preservation can really do for us. I think everything should be done to save this place, and others like it. There’s a lot more to all this than just Victorian mansions and Brown University’s table scraps. '

  content: ' Unfortunately the fate of this beautiful building follows a national pattern. Very many of my generation, the baby boomers, have forsaken their history and cultural heritage to pursue materialism and ego, and worship wealth. With that, wondeful historical structures like the Grove St. School will fall to the same effective underhanded tactics, which is to send the historic buildings into disrepair and even intentionally damage them to induce condemnation. The shallow disregard is made so very clear with the “eyesore” and “jealousy” comments from those who hold no value on their history and culture, and only see their own ego or personal gain as the main priority. I wish the best to those who have not forsaken community values and wish to preserve these structures. It is wise for all of us to hold our elected officials responsible in being proper guardians for these public properties. The Grove St. School, like many, was likely sold to pad public coffers and offset some red ink, but no regard for the fate of this historic structure was included in this sale. I fear these wealthy owners will likely win in this battle as they destroy this beautiful piece of history for their own gain. As the old saying goes, there are no rich people in heaven.'

  content: 'I would personaly like to respond to “Raymond”. First of all, Richard Tarro was and is (as you are well aware, he is deceased) one of the most generous and kindness men that I ever knew, next to my own father. You obviously did not know this man who gave so much to the Federal Hill community, Holy Ghost Church, the elderly and pretty much any human being or four legged creature that came into contact with him. His selflessness stood out when he was alive and is still praised to this day by all that knew him. He loved this neighborhood as much as he loved his own family and friends. Mr. Tarro, as well as his own father was a State Representative for the area and had only Federal Hill’s best intersts at heart. He was a stand up guy that put his name to anything and everything that he believed in and his children are and will continue to do the same with their Family business and in their own lives. As for the “Tarro Boys”, obviously you do not know them either, because ALL the Tarro children, not just the boys, share the same generous, selflessness traits that both their parents passed on to them. I have always been told that jealousy is the root of all evil, and it could not be clearer that it centers your world. To try to deter a family business that has been in this area for well over 80 years from growing and developing with the rest of the Federal Hill area, is simply just JEALOUSY.'

It was a fallout shelter, as one of the pics still had the fallout sign on building, and in there they had red hard hats, excersize bikes in boxes, tins of crackers, and these cardboard tiolets. I don’t remember the layout that well but we made a makeshift clubhouse on the top floor. Put three of the tiolets and screens to block the view of the top from the bottom of the stairs. You used to be able to enter from the back of the building through a busted door and go through what I believe was the old cafe. The Tarros are jerks, always have been. The father if he is still alive was the biggest a-hole. It’s a shame to see them ruining the building to get it torn down. I hope the funeral place down the street puts them out of business. It is a shame they don’t make that some kind of club for the neighborhood kids.'

Cruise ships could dock people who wanted to shop could take the new trolley line into the city to shop and eat in the resturants. After people have been on a ship the want to get off and explore a city. After a while they get tired of being on a boat and want to see other things. It would be a great start for the waterfrount. Other investors would then want to build there, and that would keep the money in the city. Building in the suburbs and distroying suburban neighborhoods is not where the casino should be built. Look at the Sidney opera house, it is the image one thinks of when they see a picture of Sidney. This would be the beginng of the waterfrount and help it to be developed.Let them pay to clean up the polluted soil. If they are going to spend millions of dollars it should be there. Other wise that land is going to sit there for many years to come. I can envison condos, parks cruise ships resturants concerts and bring activity to the waterfrount instead of it just sitting there unused for years.

First, to get the record straight, Zam NEVER had dogs on site (they must have been there after Zam retired and had rented the place out and before Dunkin Donuts was built). Anyway, as teenagers, my brother and I helped Zam during the summer months — I handled the front providing full service to customers (gas, oil, air, water... Oh, those overheated radiators were tough), and my brother helped Zam with car repairs in the shop. The place was like a Barney Miller sitcom — we had many “old guy” visitors such as “Smitty” (Yankee fan), “Old Pop” (Red Sox fan), and of course, “The Chief”, a Narragansett Indian who also worked with Zam during the winter and would visit in the summer to teach us how we could survive in the woods with a nail and a piece of string! It was a neighborhood with many African Americans (we were Italian) at a time (late 60s and 70s) when there was a lot of tension between blacks and whites — but many of our customers were black and we all got along so well — it shaped the person I am today, and I am proud of that.'

As a child I spent alot of time with her as she grew older. Initially, you could just walk into the building and either climb the stairs to infinity or push a button and take the elevator. The whole building was made of rebarb enforced concrete. Every two apartments shared a 6&quot; x 12&quot; concrete porch with a green corragated plastic sheet which covered the chain link fence to ensure privacy from those below. My grandmother used to like to sun bathe on her lawn chair with her iced coffee by her side. Her apartment (also concrete throughout) was always styling. You would never smell moth balls when you walked into her pad! She always had the latest and greatest furniture and decor of the day and the place was always spotless. She had current pictures of the family on the walls and of course there was the religeous pictures which hung in every room. I believe the only thing she had that was “old” was a picture of her mother, which sat in a “current” frame. Then of course there was the neighbors. Mrs. Early down at the end of the building, who would waddle her way up and down the front catwalk, snapping her gum with the three teeth she had left and looking to strike up a conversation with whoever was willing. Mary Weston, who lived a few doors down had a million stories to tell about her life and the people in it. I would sit in her apartment and listen to her stories and she would feed me. After my grandmother died I would still visit the folks at 22 Whelan Road. It made me feel a little closer to the memory of my grandmother and I still loved to hear the neighbors re-runs. There were alot of people who lived in the apartments of all four big buildings. They all had a life, a history, a story to tell. And they all mattered. As they all died off they left their legacy within the halls, walls and stairwells of those big buildings. And now... it’s all gone, as if none of it ever mattered.  '

In 1960, my family moved from a cold-water tenement (2 bedrooms, no hot water) to this building, apartment 6L. We had 3 bedrooms, one for the 3 boys, one for the 3 girls, and 1 for my parents. The building was a hotbed of crime at the time and got worse after. But I was VERY happy to have grown up in that housing project, and to this date, 46 years after I moved in, I am still friendly with many of the similarly situated neighbors. I look on my 12 years living in the project as WONDERFUL. I worked in 2 nearby stores, Bills Variety, and Lanes Spa, and also worked in Joe’s Shell Station. Those jobs enabled me to know EVERY resident of the project, with hundreds of apartments. I went on to work for the police department, and retired in 1989. The building, VERY well constructed, took 3 months to demolish with a swinging ball. Every apartment was replaced by what is called scattered site housing, much better modern housing for our lower income fellow citizens. '

Stephen O’Rourke of the Providence Housing Authority testified in court that this building was in danger of falling over from a 30 mile wind gust… that was a lie.

The building dropped a certain number of feet… and then rested, without fully imploding. We all kind of just stood there, mouths open, shocked and waiting… nothing further happened. Guess something had gone wrong with the wiring of the dynomite, not fully enabling it to implode the building. They eventually had to demolish the remainder of the building manually. It stood there for quite some time before fully demolished. I used to visit an elderly woman there, and also went to school across the street at Oliver Hazard Perry. '

I heard the blast, and knew what it was. This was about 6 miles away from the blast site. I also recall that Providence was listed in Newsweek as one of the “Hot Cities” to live in, and the mayor saying something to the effect of “We live in one of the hottest cities and we’re blowing up buildings.” I also remember my great grandmother living in that building in the early 70’s, when the dominant population of the buildings were elderly people.'

It was demolished by the 1954 hurricane, all that was left was the wall at the sidewalk. My father worked at United Wire on Elmwood ave. The company would have their annual outing at the park. which included lobster, chowder and clam cakes, all you could eat, I never left that place hungry thats for sure. My father did not drive so we took the rocky point bus from Providence. Me and the kids would pull up to the dock by boat and get chowder and clam cakes for many years after that.'

My cousin Joe, Bob, Paul, Ed, Bruce, and I spent almost every day either on the midway or at the pool in the summers of 1962-1966. One of our mothers would drive us to the park, give us couple bucks and would pick us up around 4. The pool took a token worth .50 and Sue was always there to let us through the turnstile. What a beautiful girl, we were all smitten. We were 11-12 and she was 15-16, always wore animal skin looking bathing suits. Enough of that, we would swim and listen to pop music piped over load speaker systems, it had a three tier diving board, we would dive off the first two but that 3rd one was way up their. After a while we would leave, get a hand stamp to get back in (from Sue) and either go on the midway or jump on the trampolines on the water front. The midway was a great experience to observe and walk, sometimes stepping on a lit cigarette butt barefoot not fully extinguished, ouch ouch, they had rides, penny arcade (yes using real pennies back then) and food vendors, but best of all side shows. I remember seeing a Freak Show, that was real strange, a guy looking like Buffalo Bill pounding spikes into his head, up his nose, through his lips, and not bleeding. I could go on and on but what I wanted to say also was my very first job was at Rocky point at the World Famous Shore Dinner Hall, busboy. $1.20 per hour. I just retired after 49 years of working and I owe it all to that first job. '

But when we got there, it  was worth the wait. Dad knew the owner, Conrad. Dad was a Teamster, so we had the company picnics there. When I was a kid, I wanted to go on the rides and not go into the Shore Dinner Hall. Then at an older age it was the Shore Dinner Hall and not the rides. I just couldn’t take the horizontal spins.

I can remember my dad taking us on the Wild Cat and rocking it at the top before it dived down. We were so scared, but we went on it everytime. Eating in the Chowder House was like nothing I’ve ever experenced before. It was HUGE. People just sat near each other and shared bowl and bowls of chowder and cakes.  We were there when it was not crowded and I remember  sometimes waiting to get in. I have a picture of me and my dad at the Rocky Point Bar with hats on and holding up empty bottles of Falstaff. We took my sister’s first boyfriend there with us. She was about 15. I remember her boyfriend prucking all over the place on the Spider. My dad and I were laughing. He had to buy a shirt. My sister got one to match. When I was dating my husband, we use to go there every weekend and walk around. He would fish off the rocks and I would sunbath. We’d eat chowder and cakes to go and just hang. When we had kids, we brought them there every weekend also to sit on the rocks and eat, or go into the park. It never mattered to them if they rode the rides or not. Sometimes we would just hang out and people watch. The House of Horrors was my favorite ride. Onetime we were watiching fireworks on the grass and we were so close the cardboard from the fireworks were coming down around us. It was so cool. Thank you for this blog. It has brought back many many happy memories.'

I worked there in the summer at the redemption center with “mama Leake” and sometimes at the game booths. It was a huge part of my growing up experience. I can remember the salt water pool with the 3 diving boards, the rides, the concerts the fire works, the food (Chowda and clam cakes!) my first kiss ever was in the haunted house! It was just such a wonderful place... an amusement park where you could go have fun ride the rides and smell the ocean! They used to have the show near the top of the midway where they would shoot a man out of a cannon to! Life now is so hectic, busy and commercialized, I love six flags but it just doesn’t have the same feel that rocky point had.  my uncle was a year round employee of the park and I spent many winter vacations from school at the arcarde with him and hanging around with all the other people from the park. I can remember at the end of the nights in the summer, the counting room for all the money was in the back of the redemption center, after all was counted my uncle (who did the evening drops at the bank) would pull his car up the midway and they would load bag after bag of money into his old dodge until the back of the car almost was dragging to the ground! I went there yesterday (sunday the 4th)  along with lots and lots of other people. What a disgrace this, to have let this beautiful and historic part of rhode island fall into disarray I sat an creid yesterday afternoon just looking at what had become of this treasure. It was like being in a movie and so surreal. You could almost hear the ghosts of all the people in the wind... Rocky point was such a special place, it should be reborn into something special that everyone can use and enjoy!

  content: 'I am so excited to have found this site. My husband and I spent the day at Six Flags a couple days ago and I found myself talking a lot about Rocky Point (he’s not a native Rhode Islander). The memories were so strong that I had to Google it yesterday and I ended up here. I read other people’s memories and I was so overcome with emotion and nostalgia that I couldn’t stop crying. Rocky Point was a HUGE part of my childhood. My dad used to take my older sister and me, infrequently at first in the mid 70s when we were just little kids because at that time there were other parks he’d take us to as well, like Crescent Park and Jolly Cholly’s, then we started going more frequently in the late 70s, early 80s. We’d go practically every Sunday in the summer, sometimes every other Sunday, back when they used the different combinations of the colored string bracelets with the colored jaw clasp to designate admission on the different days. We couldn’t wait to hear the jingle on the radio because that meant that school was out and Rocky Point was open! Dad had an El Camino then and on some days he’d let us ride in the back and we would jabber the whole way about which rides we were going to go on, and how we were gonna ram each other on the Bumper Cars, and were we brave enough to finally try the Enterprise?  I remember sitting in traffic that would sometimes start a mile or so back from the entrance and we would practically be jumping out of skins with anticipation and excitement. We would be crawling along and be so happy once we passed the “Rocky Point” sign and got into the park. We’d ride the Musik Express and be so happy when the DJ played a song we liked. We would watch the Tilt-A-Whirl to see which car spun the most and then we’d grab that one. I’ll never forget how scared I was to go on the Enterprise the first time only to realize how much I LOVED it and would ride it countless times after that. The Cyclone was one of our absolute favorite rides and we must have ridden that thing 10 times during each visit, I can still remember how my stomach would flutter when we flew down that first hill.  How we loved to ride the Flume only to scream if we got too wet or the water was too cold! And I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizza! I remember one time my sister was playing the ring toss game because she desperately wanted to win one of the big stuffed bears, while I impatiently pleaded with her to stop playing and ride the rides with me, which she finally did.  At one point, we got off one of the rides (I think the Musik Express) and there was Dad holding the bear she so wanted so badly! He had played and played that stupid game until he won it for her. Dad would finally say it was time to go, and we would PLEAD for just one more ride, usually the Musik Express or the Cyclone. When we got older into our teens and my sister got her license, we would go with our friends and then it was all about riding the rides and noticing BOYS! This was mid-to-late 80s and the park was still always packed and we would still sit in traffic to get in and we would STILL be excited to ride the rides! In the early 90s, I would go with my boyfriend or my friends and it was still fun, but not as much. I’m not sure why that is, maybe because there was a different crowd of people that started frequenting the place. Gone were the days when Dad could sit on one of the benches and read the Sunday Journal while his two young daughters would safely roam the park. Also, some of it may have been that I was in my early 20s and at that age, you are in such a rush to grow up and enter adulthood, I think maybe you start to disassociate from many things which symbolize your childhood, which RP definitely did for me. Anyway, I think the last time I went while RP still had rides was maybe 93 or 94, I was with a bunch of friends and I’m ashamed to admit that I may even have deemed the park as “lame”. The very last time I was there was October 98, there was some Halloween-themed event going on (which really WAS lame), and that was it. Maybe about 4 years ago, my husband and I went to visit some friends who live not far from RP and I wanted to drive by to see what was left. When I saw the sign in disrepair and looking so, I don’t know, ignored and unloved (crazy, I know, but that’s what it looked like), I burst into tears. You don’t really begin to treasure precious memories until you are older and more mature and have a broader, wiser perspective on things, and nostalgia sets in. Now I’m 39 and my dad is very ill, which rips my heart apart and makes me cry very easily. Reliving these memories is both exhilaratingly wonderful and terribly heartbreaking. The knowledge that Rocky Point is gone and the fate of its property in the hands of greedy soul-sucking developers is bad enough, but I hate that treasuring these memories occurred so belatedly, after the time has already passed to fight for RP’s survival. I wish it was still here. If I close my eyes, I can still see us sitting in the parking lot in the back of Dad’s El Camino, eating clam cakes and throwing the scraps to the seagulls.'

My sister Angela worked in the office. My sister Maureen was about to get married and reside in maryland. As for me [Kathy] my twin [Karen] and our brother Kevin and our beautiful Mom we visited almost everyday. We could ride any ride we wanted for free because we were Jerrys kids. Everyone knew who we were, we got away with nothing.The flume water ride was forbidden, to many accidents. Ill never for get the fire works on the 4 of july by the water. The best!!!!!! My dad told us to stay away from the gypsys b/c they would steal us. My dad just did not want us to go to that side of the park. Who Knows! I heard that gypsys wanted to buy my dad when he was a baby. Maybe thats why he said that .Ill never know. My dad Jerry DiCapua died on July the 9, after working 4 of july weekend in the park at the Family Kingdom in Myrtle beach,SC. The amusement park was his life, his love besides my mom of 59 years. Everyone who knew my dad LOVED him as his family did. He was funny,smart,handsome and had a quick left,and a right. I am sure he was a pain in the ass every now and then. [right Mom].

I worked in the food stands because I was underage and could not work the rides or the games. I landed the job as the shift manager at the cotton candy stand and all of my friends made fun of me because it was a sticky job and you always smelled like candy floss. I just grinned and barred it. The stand was right at the outdoor stage and I saw every band and stage show that came to the park. No one bought cotton candy during the shows. I was great. As a local kid we knew every way to seek in. There were holes in the fence behind the House of Horrors and up in the woods at the top end of the flume. I wonder why no one ever fixed them. We used to sneak in after the park closed and look for money that fell out patrons pockets under the Music Express. We always left with some money. I also remember the salt water pool with the high diving platforms. It was a lot of scary fun for a kid. You don’t find anything like it now.

I can best describe my experiences at Rocky Point as “I had a blast”.  I practically ran from ride to ride so that I could “fit” as much as possible into one day. I remember getting sick a couple of times, vomiting in the barrels. The tossing and turning of the rides didn’t always agree with my eating plenty of the shore dinner. Even with that, I had to practically be restrained to keep me from immediately running back to the rides. Rocky Point was like a heaven for kids. When I was there, I felt like “this must be heaven”, it was the greatest! Even as an adult, it seems to me that it is a part of my childhood that I shall never outgrow, the scarier, the faster, the more challenging the better. I was deeply saddened to learn of the park’s closing, such a loss to not only Rhode Island, but to New England. I miss Rocky Point, and I wish they’d bring it back! I think they should build a hotel somewhere on the grounds with a view of the ocean. Hotel guests could take their kids to the park to bring in more heads.

Man, all I can say about RP is that it felt dreamy going there as kids. I visited last when I was 18-19, just prior to it closing. I had thought about it many times over the past 20 years, but just recently my lady and I were in the Warwick area. Being that she is not from R.I., I took her there and I was very disappointed to see how the entrance was locked up, along with the many signs reminding outsiders to keep out. It made me just really want to cry seeing one of the only theme and amusement parks in this state just go complete bankrupt. You would think that this state would just fund the park for the good of all its residents. Frankly, RP is a landmark and will always remain a landmark and a place where memories will never be lost. Let’s petition for it to come back or something. I wonder what would happen if we parked the car and went in. Very macabre like, but very indulging at the same time :)'

  content: 'WOW! Rocky Point!... I had not thought about this place for years. I was looking at some youtube videos, and came across the old commercial for RP. Let me give you a little info. My father ran security at the park from the middle 70s (after Eddie Silva, Warwick PD) until the late 80s. May of you will remember SGT. then LT. Jim Godbout from the Warwick PD. We thought that RP was our very own playground! I remember coming through the gate, getting our hand stamped by Mr. Ferla or Mr Casciolli(sp?). Conrad gave me my first job at the shore dinner hall in 79, washing dishes with big Jim Kelly, and learning to make clamcakes with Julio. I will always remember the words “CHOWDER DOWN BOYS”, that meant we had to carry one of those steaming cauldrons down to the takeout window. In 82 I went to work for the games division, and my summers were a blast! I met more girls than you could shake a stick at! I even ran the Whack A mole game when they brought it in. Being a gamer at RP was a blast. I continued working there until 84 when I graduated from Hendricken, and joined the Marines. My sister, Lori Greaves, and her husband Jeff, had their reception at the Windjammer. Do you remember Agnes? I miss that tough old bird! She use to smoke unfiltered Luck Strikes! The last time that I went to the park was 1987 with my wife. She had never ridden a loop coaster until the corkscrew, and will never again. She was 6 months pregnant with our first son, and she was shaking so bad that she could not stand up to get off the ride. So as I look at the pictures of what is left of that wonderful place from my childhood, it fills me with great sadness. It is a shame that another generation will never get to watch the fireworks from behind the office. Get that first kiss in the house of horrors or enjoy that special Rhode Island treat of clam cakes and chowder. And to all of our friends that are still up there, Jim, Kathy, Jori, and Jon are all here in Charleston SC and doing fine. I can be reached at retailtuna [at] yahoo [dot] com.

I ended up spending the summer working with a lot of others from England, France, and various other European countries (Hannah, Sarah, Berengere, Dave, Paul, Mark). We had a blast! They housed us down in the dorms at URI and bussed us in every day. It was a non-stop good time. Oddly enough, I don’t think I ever rode any of the rides. I worked in the Kiddieland area. I was planning to go back for a visit and came across this website saying it’s closed... bummer. I live in California now and would love to hear from any others who worked there that summer.'

So I’m in RI to visit friends and we took a drive to Warick on July 27, 2008 (2 days ago). It was nearly dark and a light rain coming down. The dead end of the street was dark and eerie and as we approached the entrance we saw that the entire cinderblock sign was in rubble on both sides of the gate. VERY creepy looking! The 2 overhead streetlights were there but not lit up. The entrance was almost completely overgrown and you couldn’t see anything! A car slowly drove by us and someone yelled out “Go ahead... go inside... it’s ok”. Are they NUTS??? NO WAY! I took several pics, a chunk of painted cinderblock, shed a few tears and was on my way.. I’ll post some pics in the very near future.'

Conrad Ferla never shot or ate the pigeons. The pigeons where a nuisance, they roosted on the rides by the hundreds. At the time that was the only safe way to rid the Park of them. Remember, we are talking of the fifties and part of the sixties...'

I use to dive off the diving board with my two sisters and brother. We had so much fun going down the slide and just haveing fun. I remember the House of Horrors. I was so scared when i was a little girl but as i got older i knew it wasn’t true. I went in there over and over again. I use to go on the spider but not very many times because i didn’t like it when it went around and around. I use to get sick as a dog when it went around. Then comes the bumper cars. I use to love going on them several times in a row. Then it was the Skee ball. I loved getting all those tickets and then cashing them in and getting prizes. The skydiver was fun too!!! And then comes the rockets. I use to love the rockets. I rode them over and over again. I loved to go high in the sky as a kid. It sure was fun. Then the musik Express and boy did it go fast forward and then backwards. I loved it. Then the skyliner after you go on the flume. It somewhat made you dry from the sea air. You could smell the sea air up high in the sky. It sure was fun. On hot days you go on the flume just to cool off and get dry on the skyliner. What a way to go!!! I loved the train ride just to slow down a bit. What a shame that this family playground is all gone. Those are great pictures of the park but it’s not the same. I sure miss you Rocky Point. I was with you all during the late 60’s and early 70’s and it sure was fun. It was a family gathering for all families until one day it’s gone. But the memories in my heart will never fade away.

We took  buses there, the school had packed lunch for us (subs, chips, soda) which I remember eating outside the park in the lot near the Corkscrew.  I remember being completely immature and there were porta potties near a cliff and while my friend was in one we all started shaking it and she started screaming.  I remember spitting at each other while riding on the swings. I remember loving the Musik Express and the Flume. The corkscrew was fun. My favorite ride was the Free Fall, which kept breaking every two minutes. I remember one or two times it broke while we were on it. That ride was so much fun.  I remember one ride which was this little car that was on a ferris like wheel. You’d sit in it with another person and there was a wheel you could spin that would make the car spin around. I got so sick in that! I nearly lost my lunch! That was the only time I went there. My neighbors went many times with their family. It’s so sad that it closed.

She would stamp the hands of the swimmers as they would enter the pool pavillion. I remember watching Billy Ross on the highest driving board, he was stricken by electricution and lost both arms. He had one stub, but after he dove, he could still swim to get out of the pool. Anyone who saw him, could not believe it, what a sight. I also was a summer resident of ROCKY BEACH every summer from the Fifties, with my parents, Grandparents, and the BEST of all, is where I met my BEST FRIEND in the world, LINDA DEQUARTTRO! She is still my best friend to this very day. We have been friends for at least fifty years. We  would go to ROCKY POINT as little girls, and sit in her mother, Artea’s ticket booth for hours. She was the HEAD cashier, at the MAIN ticket booth, in the center of the park, next to the CASTLE OF TERROR. We could not it for the day that we would be old enough to work there. My sister Doreen Stephen also worked there, with her best friend JANET CHAFFEE. By the way Janet, i read yor anecdote, and it was wonderful that you mentioned Doreen and I. We can also remember all the Fourth  of July’s, watching the best fireworks ever,  on the beach near the pool. It was fabulous. At the time we worked at the park Mark Scala was manager and before that it was Conrad Ferls. He would ride through the park, on a motor scooter, checking things out. We had the time of our lives. I will never forget it. The concerts, I rember JANIS JOPLIN for free!! And i will never  forget the free acts, the best being THE ZACCKINIS, ANNON BALL as they out of a cannon that was attached to truck, into a net in the middle of the MIDWAY. WOW what a sight !!! Living so close to ROCKY POINT, at  ROCKY BEACH  was the best. Linda and I would walk to work, and home every day and night not caring how late it was, we would walk through a path at the end of the parking lot near the batting range, right into her back yard. My father Al Stephen was the caretaker of Rocky Beach, he loved it so much there, as did my mom, Rita. I can not believe that it is gone now. How could the city let this happen to a most beautiful area in the entire state. These memories are instilled in my heart , and will be forever. LONG LIVE ROCKY POINT PARK. I SURE WILL MISS YOU. '

I was an English student at the park working as a Foods Supervisor for the summers of 1989 and 1990.


I stayed in the big scary (and we thought haunted) house for the first year, just outside the park, and the boys were in beach houses just across the car park. The second year I lived above the main office… my room was kitted out with an oven, microwave and really was a home from home! I remember Nancy LaVoie, Pat Costello and Jerry who were also supervisors. Cheryl used to work in the office… everyone was great to us students!


We were treated like royalty... mainly because of our accents &ndash; and most of us spoke the best english ever whilst we were there!


I remember the night when Sam Fox played… we all cringed… she was a nightmare from home… but really big over there then… Guns and Roses also came and quite a few big acts &ndash; we always wanted to work on the beer carts on the nights when there was a band playing as you could make a fortune in tips… although I think again a lot of that was due to the accent!


I remember we all used to go to TeDens the bar at the end of the road after work, and it was brilliant… the parties in the dorms were fantastic and I have so many photos and happy memories of when we all worked there.

In those days it was fine to hitch a lift, and I remember quite a few times we got lifts to Stop and Shop for supplies!


Working the ice cream stand was brilliant &ndash; and depending on who served you you’d get a tiny cone or some great massive ice cream covered in jimmys!


Ben and Jerrys also had a stand there in 1990, I used to go with Pun Pandya and open the gazebo and we’d have ice cream for breakfast &ndash; it was just being launched then… I remember going to Newport and seeing it in a shop there and at the time we thought that was pretty amazing… now Ben and Jerrys is everywhere &ndash; you can get it in every supermarket over here now… and it always reminds me of RPP!


They were great times, doughboys, chowder and clam cakes, salt water taffy, sloppy joes in the canteen… all these things were new and fab for us! Years later I was in New York and drove to RI to visit RPP… only to find it had closed down… it was so sad… Amazing memories… fantastic photos and great friendships!'

I remember my WORST memory of Rocky point was back in the mid seventies. My mom was a school bus driver for Smithfield, and there was a class field trip for either the junior or senior high school students. My little sister and I had to go along. We spent the whole day OUTSIDE the park, because my mom didn’t want to take us in (probably because we was po’ folk back then). Yup, the WHOLE day, outside in the parking area, watching the rides. It was then that I truly understood the concept of Purgatory.


My first job was at Rocky Point, in the Ice Cream stand. I was working there when one of the managers tried to burn it down in the &lsquo;80s. I loved the House of Horrors, and we used to get out of the cars and walk around scaring people. I can still smell the clam cakes in the Shore Dinner hall.


The people of RI deserve to have that spot preserved for future generations to enjoy with their families. It would make a great waterfront park for picnics and family get togethers. We all know what will actually happen, though, don’t we? Well connected cronies will get theri claws into it, and it will be lost forever to us. To add insult to injury, they will probably get State money somehow to do it. So sad.'

I believe it was the second party thrown there. The rave was called CAMP EARTH and people were there from all over the world because it was an amusement park rave,something virtually unheard of. There were a little over 18,000 people there. The very best house,trance,breakbeat,jungle,and happy hardcore d.j’s were there, from around the globe. The rides ran all night and the wind jammer and the paladium jumped all night until about 12:00 pm the next day. Prior to that I used to pedal my bike from Providence just to get there.

All we had to do to get to the park was walk through a path in some tall grass. We went to the pool and park on a daily basis. We would search the parking lot for admission bracelets and slip them on. One summer the park just started giving us free admission. I remember being so disappointed when the pool closed. The cottages and park were a great place to grow up and I am very sad to see them go. My kids will not have a chance to be the 5th generation to grow up there. I wanted to do something my own style to remember Rocky Point so I wrote a horror movie and started to film a little around the cottages but it was a late idea the last summer we were allowed there and I ran out of time.

Then i ran the Roto Jet ( which was located on top of ona concession stand. . In fact while i was reading some of these letters that the people wrote i reconize some of the old timers . Carol Strang ...if you read this i just want to say hello. You were describing the house you lived in and it does bring back memories. The night we all would close down our rides and head to oakland beach . We were called the twin eagles because a lot of us had motorcycles . We had a special table that we sat at.. Yea...old memories....Beach parties and girls. John Ferla would walk around the park checking on us and every once in a while he would yell and say ( in italian accent) ...Fuster boy Fuster. I grow up really having a lot of respect for that man. Then there was the times that his brother Conrad would drive thru the pakk with his big RED caddy and that plate will always be in my mind. RPP ! . Joe carusso (the maintaince man went around the park from earley morning till the park closed repairing the rides. When the power went out in the park we had to react fast to stop our rides in a safe manner and get the people off, Then i would go over to the ferris wheel and help the operator there. The wheel couldn’t turn so while he worked the cluth i would climb the outside of the wheel and turn the wheel . so many memorise and not to mention my first really love...who i lost because i was young and stupid but i still think of her after 40 years. Rocky point Park will never die as it is in my heart'

Kix 106 threw these concerts with a variety of acts at once. I got some autographs there, too. Too bad I didn’t have a camera back then. Didn’t get to bring my son there for he was too little to go on anything before they closed the park down. I loved the Corkscrew, Tilt a Whirl, Music Express, a d the Rock N Roll. Those are classic rides. The House of Horrors was funny just to go through. Those were the days. Unfortunately, this state doesn’t have anything else. You have to travel to surrounding states to an amusement park. Weird Al Yankovic played at RPP years ago, along with Stevie B. The Flume was one of the best rides there on a hot summer’s day. Don’t even have to go on it to get wet, just stand next to the fence. So long, RPP, you will be greatly missed. '

Later on in the summer of 73 I worked there starting out in the Castle of Terror and ending up on the “Crew” of the Zyclone. We flew “bombing missions”. Mrs Woods would save the big mustard and ketchup containers for us that were then filled with water. We would time the cars so one of us was in a car above pouring a sheet of water in front of an unsuspecting car. There was no way out. People would get off the ride more soaked than the Flume and thought it was part of the ride. They thought it was great! Many run-ins with Alan Ferla who was always bailed out by Conrad Sr. Many more stories abound!'

Conrad sr used to love me and called me “a hard working irish boy” then of course I would get caught eating a clam cake by jr and get the boot.

It was such a special time for me and my Dad. He would ride every ride with me. We actually got stuck on one ride I can’t remember the name of it, but it was like the ferris wheel because it went around in a big circle and you sat in this box container that also went in a circle. We got stuck at the top and my Dad couldn’t stop the box from spinning and I was screaming and they couldn’t get the ride moving again for like 10 minutes, it was so scary, but I also remember thinking how strong my Dad was and how much he loved me trying to keep us safe. We never did ride that ride again. But we continued to go every year. Once I was old enough to work I had my first job at the park working for the games. I had so much fun. I still have a frog leg and a ring from two of the games that I treasure. This is truly sad and will be missed. I feel like a large part of my childhood is gone. I wish I could be there just one more time to enjoy the rides and eat the great food and hear all the people laughing and screaming with joy! Goodbye Rocky Point Park you will truly be missed.'

  content: 'One of the finer points of my chilhood has vanished, though quite expectedly. My parents owned a cottage on Common Fence Point where we spent our summers. It was a common occurance for us to visit Lincoln Park, Crescent Park and Rocky Point every year. Being an incredibly innocent child, I remembered how terrified I was just seeing the House of Horrors. The dragon with head in claw was especially scary to me. I remember thinking, “If that’s on the outside, what’s hiding on the inside?” That was the summer of &#8216;72 when I was 11. A few years went by and as a graduating 8th grader, my middle school took us on a field trip to RP. I finally made it throught the H of H and laughed at the comparison of what I had dreaded might be inside to what I actually saw. But no matter. It was fun just the same. After that, my trips to RP were less with my parents and more with friends. A few trips, here and there, every year. But it was in 1983 that RP became an important summer ritual. I spent EVERY weekend at RP. Sometimes on Saturday, sometimes only Sunday, but for the better part of the summer, it was the whole weekend. I remember the Fixx playing one night. A particularly favorite band of mine at the time. As the years went by, you could see how they weren’t managing the place properly. One year, it was free admission and you payed for your tickets at the kiosks. The next it was charging admission just to get it. The next it was free admission again, but the ticket prices were comparibly outrageous. At the same time, you never knew what rides would be there from one year to the next. I was fortunate, however, to get my two boys to the park the year it closed. One more time of enjoying “a place for family fuuuuuuuun…” I took many pictures of that final summer. I’ve not been back since it was closed. (Too afraid of being caught trespassing). But from what I’ve seen here, maybe i’ll walk down there one more time, even if there’s nothing left. It doesn’t matter. As many of us can attest, if I stand there, among the weeds, cracks, debris, graffitti, and bits and pieces of our past, I’m sure I’ll still hear the sound of the Music Express, the girlish screams coming from the Rock-N-Roll, and I’m sure there’ll be a lingering smell of dust, diesel, popcorn and sea air. Maybe I won’t… but I’ll remember it.'

I have very fond memories of the entire park, but especially the salt water swimming pool which I visited frequently, dinners with the family at the Shore Dining Hall and “pigging out” on the awesome clam chowder and clam cakes, and WVMHS Junior Prom (class of 62) at the Pallidium. I haven’t lived in RI since 1962 but I knew that the park had been closed. I had no idea of what it now looked like until I viewed some current videos and photos.

  content: 'Reading what the other have written and the photos of what has happened to “ROCKY POINT PARK” a very special place for quite a few years of my life brings a tear to my eye and memories of those years come flooding back. My earlist recolection of the park goes back to the 1960’s as it was considered a amusement park for grownups or more appropiatley kids who considered themselves grownups LOL as we felt that we had outgrown &quot;CRESCENT PARK&quot;.From the flume to the roller coaster it was all very new to us. Then in 1975 I got my first job there working the &quot;SKOOTER&quot;with a friend as we took turns switching sides alternating from taking the riders tickets to being the guy who showed them the way out after the ride ended and untangling the cars that were stuck in positions that the operator could not get out of themselves. Then in 1976 I was operating the &quot;HOUSE OF HORRORS&quot; when as per ususal there was a rock concert on the old midway stage next to the &quot;ROCKY GAME/GIFT, SOUIVNER SHOP&quot; and a unheard of band from austraila AC/DC was playing that night. Most of us know the band nowdays because of the onstage antics of the lead guitarist &quot;ANGUS THE SCHOOLBOY YOUNG&quot; and it was a rather dead night on the rides as most of the people there were watching the concert. I took the 1977 season off due to a better offer from another job but in 1978 I was right back there operating the &quot;ROUNDUP&quot; and the &quot;ROCK AND ROLL&quot; rides but a lot of us could see the writing on the wall as often we would go hours between riders and even the game operaters noticed a decline in buisness even on traditionaly busy friday nights and weekends. Then as summers went along we heard about the &quot;CORKSCREW-LOOP&quot; ROLLER COASTER being built and they were going to add a proper stage for concerts on the midway near the &quot;FLUMES&quot; BIG DROP HILL and that we were going to get a &quot;FREEFALL&quot;RIDE. But even with all the new attractions including a &quot;ROCK &amp;ROLL REVIVAL SHOW&quot; with legends of rock and roll &quot;THE TOKENS&quot; the &quot;SPIRAL STAIRCASE&quot; and even &quot;TINY TIM&quot; performing the crowds returned for a while but as quickly that they returned they were gone and rumors started being spread that layoffs would be happening and that the park was having problems paying its bills. So I started looking for a more stable job and I never worked their again. Then the news about the park closing it’s doors for good confirmed all that we had heard.And then the fires and vandalism that has stricken the park just tears another peice of my heart off along with the news that the idea that housing would be built at the site of the park is in limbo make my pain a little worse.I was against tearing the remaining buildings of the park down but after seeing pictures taken recently I feel that even though a lot of rhode islands residents have very fond memories of &quot;ROCKY POINT PARK&quot; we ther they worked there or just enjoyed a day or weekend there It’s time to close the book on this part of rhode island history and finish the job that MINDLESS, THOUGHTLESS VANDALS have started. thank you very much.'

But today I did a quick search and found this website. It brought back many fond memories of the two summers I worked at the park. My friend, Christian, and I lived above the main office building. We were in charge of distributing tickets, collecting cash and bringing change to all of the ticket booths in the park. It was by far the best summer job I had. We each had a Yamaha Razzee scooter that we would whip around the park in doing our collections and deliveries. Sometimes we would take the scooters “off-road” over to the Rocky Village area (I forget the correct name) or bomb around the park when it was empty. Super fun times. I especially enjoyed “teaching” the lucky (or unlucky, depending how you look at it) kids sitting next to me on the Freefall how to push up on the safety bar a bit and lift your feet during to freefall to get a better sense of falling. Everyone that worked there were great people, I forget some names now, but David, Angelo, Jimmy, the office gang and everyone else were incredibly friendly people.

When I got older and drove myself again it was a fovorite place to go with my friends in tow. I miss Rocky Point and am sorry for what is happening to one of the most wonderful places on earth. At least I have my childhood memories of family outings to remember.

Although I am a boat owner, there is nothing more enjoyable than being able to take a walk and sit by the sea. In the early 80’s I would scuba dive there for clams with my buddy, whose dad was the president of the park. The amount of shellfish along the shores in 3 - 5 feet of water was staggering. I can remember one day diving under the dock for little necks. I think i got about 600 lbs of clams in a couple of hours. More memorable were the artifacts that I collected that day underwater. I still have the silverware and the plates from the old shore dinner hall. I also found everything from thousands of AK47 bullets in clips, to gold chains, telephones, a mortorcycle, coins, even a visa gold card. I believe the DEM would dump confiscated shellfish at the end of the dock. Lucky for me I hit the mother load. Now that I have children, it seems shamefull that good old Linc Chaffee allowed this gem of the sea to go to private hands. Seems like there is no regard for tradition in this date. Rocky Point, Brenton Tower, Crescent Park, whats next??

My mom and dad used to take me and a friend or two about five times every summer and I took a girl there on a date in 1983. I’d been there after that date but as I got older I went much less. In fact my memories are only from my very young years. As a child I cherished that place. In July 2003 my friend and I squeezed through a hole in the fence to get one last look, take pictures and in some way to say goodbye. I have those pictures we took but they are quite sad to look at.

I was petrified of some of the rides there, especially the Free Fall. I remember my sister was in the Woonsocket High School band, and they played for President Bush when he was there and all I wanted to do was go explore the park. It was so much fun! The last time I went there was with the Boys &amp; Girls Club in 1995 and it was pretty dead, so all the lines were very short. I took it upon myself to finally ride some of the rides I hadn’t had the courage to ride earlier (though I never did ride the Free Fall). Of all the places I looked forward to going during the summer, this topped the list.


The ride I think was the most fun was the one where your body was only held in by centrifical force. It started spinning on the ground, and eventually would tilt completely vertical like a ferris wheel. I’ve never seen a ride to this day that operated like that one — at least not one that inverted like that. I miss Rocky Point so much!'

The years i cannot remember. But my mom was one of the original cooks in the old shore dinner hall right on the water! My dad worked there also but i dont remember what exactly he did. We lived many places in Rhode Island. But the one place i remember the most is right on Palmer Ave around the corner from the back gate. Cursey’s bar was just about in our back yard. As a matter of fact it was in our back yard! My mom and i and my sister and step dad lived in a 2 story house. it sat right next to another 2 story house. We were right across from Rocky Beach. This might jog a few memories too. We had a big garden and at one point we opened a vegetable stand and grew and sold our own stuff. What we did not grow, we would go into providence to the farmers market and buy stuff there to sell! Ring a bell yet? Well it had been years sense my mom and real dad had worked there. But when i got old enough i went to see John and Conrad Ferla and they gave me a job in the ticket booths. What a blast i had. I even met my first sweetheart or 2 there also!. I espicially remember one in particular! I loved my job there! But before i was old enough to work i remember going there and hanging out and i used to get alot of free rides. I got to know alot of people. I used to go ice skating in the winter on the small pond behind the pool. Of course i used to swimn in the pool too. Gosh there is so much to remember. Seeing as i lived on Palmer ave till i left home at the age of 20 to get married i had alot of time in Rocky Point. I remember the big old house on the hill also where a certain family lived. I remember the girl named Mary who my sister hung around with and i believe i hung with Marys sister! i have over 20 something years of memories. I did manage to bring my first born child there, just before they closed. my mom still lived on palmer ave at that time. I still talk to some friends of mine who lived in the other 2 stoory house next door. We have remained long distance friends over the years. They are also a part of Rocky Points past. It was funny after the park would close a whole bunch of us workers and friends from Rocky Point would head to Oakland beach for Guss’s greasy hamburgers. That place is another story. Long live Oakland Beach! I could probably write a book of memories of these places. They were the best years of my life. Now i have been married to the same guy for 35 yrs and we have 3 beautiful girls 2 of which are married. The youngest just turned 18. We also have 4 beautiful grandchildren. ages are, 2 boys are 9 and 9. Two girls are 13 and one is brand new = 2 months. I wish rocky Point was still open so i could bring them there for a good ole fashioned outing. My moms house still stands and i visit RI every couple of years. I now reside in pensacola florida.with my family. Oh yes my brother who passed away last yr also had some memories of rocky point. My sister too, but not as many memories as me! Oh yes the blue danube bar right outside the gate is where my sister had her wedding reception! our mom catered the event. My mom was also a caterar and alos owned the cozy coorner restaurant in warwick with my dad. Anyway THOSE WERE THE DAYS! just some actually. '

My brother Robbie’s first job was cleaning up after the elephant act. My brother Gary’s first job was at the salt water pool. When i was 10 I babysat for the palm reader’s four year old son for a week or so. She paid me off in ride tickets. The first thing we would do is go on the Tilt - A - whirl because the centrifugal force as the ride sped around would force change out of people’s pockets. We would reach down behind the seats and collect the money. Then we would go to the candy store at Rocky Beach, the summer colony right outside of the park property.

Theres a flash from the way back machine. Rocky point was a great place to work as a kid. I was 14 working in the shore dinner hall, started with dishes and wound up doing just about any thjing else they wanted you to do. I worked for the father Conrad who gave me the job because my two brothers before me worked there. and if they left a with a good work record thats all you needed. of course you had no identity except for your last brothers first name. Thats the way it was then. The days were long, some times 10 hrs and if there was something going on at the jammer you got a little more. Everybody was part of the big familiy.esp in the kitchen where Big John ran most things and Old Manny made the chower every day what a process that was. I used to help but just by bringing the the things he needed . Like 10 gal of potatoes 5 gals of clams and so on. Also Jack was another cook who was in charge he mostly worked on the clam cakes and parties. We had some big parties Try serving 2000 Teamsters over they’re week end. alot of watermelon. Thank god for billy rizzo this kid could cut melon like a machine and just as acurate. My God I have So much more and will never fit here. this was just the food part but i also work in thepark on rides an games. This was the summers of &#8216;67 &#8216;68. I can get a little more accurate if i go looking for pictures.'

I had a terrible fire last January and lost my home, but there are many people, all of them there for generations who are being thrown out in October (complement of the SBA). They have sold it to a big developer who has no intention of having public access, which used to be a condition of sale (to placate the public) ELECTION YEAR at the time. Now this conglomerate has publicly stated they have to rethink all of their plans. In other words, the real estate market has dropped out. They still want all of these law abiding, lovely, many elderly people with nowhere else to go, out of their own houses right away , while they spend the next three years figuring out what they might build. RIDICULOUS!!! APALLING!!!! Thank you Mayor AVEDESIAN.'

  content: 'Amazing to read this- lots of memories! I too worked at Rocky Point in games from 1969 
to 1974 to make money for URI. I could net over $1000 a summer and URI’s  tuition was $565! I remember Mark Thompson mentioned above. The Ferlas  ran the park and a number of semi-and formerly famous attractions were  brought in - Frank Sinatra Jr., Sly and the Family Stone, the Flying  Wallendas, Marlo Thomas, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, etc. 


MRB Enterprises was the company that ran games and was named after three people from Hershey PA: Mel, Ronnie and Beatrice — real low lifes! Jerry DiCapua, the son-in-law of Mrs. Leake ran all the games and employed his three kids, Jerry Jr., Brian and Angela there too. His faher-in-law ran ROCKY , the bingo place. 


But I had a great time those summers where I worked all the games but took over running the Greyhound Racing game where I made a lot of money working lots of hours (92/week) for college. I can remember collecting over $5000 in quarters on one of the big days (July4th, Labor Day)! I can still remember all the dogs names after 32 years! (Big Wig, Mike Ike, Stacey, Hacker, Shifty, Maglass, Regain, Elect, Hurry Ivan, Tivoli, Bill Me, etc.) My three brothers worked with me (Eddie and Neil worked concessions and Mike ran the Cliff House) and I met and started dating Liz Burke, a sister of one of the guys I knew who ran the Break-A-Dish stand, Kevin Burke. After hours we would all go to the Cliff House where the band, the Coachmen played and drank underage (Mike was the bartender). Liz once turned down an invitation from Gary Puckett to go on the rides with him! 


One last note about the Break-A-Dish stand — you didn’t want to work ther on the day you had to shovel out all the broken dishes! They weighed a ton! Funny thing is that RP taught me how to speak in front of people and here years later I often speak before large audiences without giving it a second thought about being nervous! Guess calling greyhound races and guessing peoples’ ages and weights on that hot midway with a scale and a microphone paid off! Liz and I married in 1974 and now live in South Carolina, the proud parents of three grown children.'

  content: 'I first came to Rocky Point on summer Friday nights during the 1960s. The Providence Evening Bulletin — no one I knew read the morning Journal — had these little ads for the park squeezed in among the movie ads. “Ride all the rides — $1 — 6 p.m. to closing.” Even my cheap old man knew a bargin when he saw one.


So several times my parents, my three brothers and I would pile into the ’63 Chevy and drive the 10 miles from East Greenwich. We loved the Dodgems and the Skyliner, and yes — more than once we jumped from the ride at its summit and walked back to the midway like 20th Century Huckleberry Finns. I’ll never forget as we left one night, my Dad complaining: “That evening cost us $22!” Guess they got us on the food!


We never were allowed to play the games, which is why I guess I was intrigued in the spring of 1971 when a buddy called me over to his table at the high school library. He was reading the want ads in the paper, and pointed to one looking for kids to work the games at Rocky Point. “MRB Enterprises” was the name of the employer — by then the rides, games and food stands were all run by different corporations

it was the beginning of the end.


But I didn’t know it, and spent five glorious summers at the park working the games. My first summer I earned a princely $1.60 an hour. While there was no overtime, working 80 hours a week could bring a kid a fairly fat paycheck. The job could definitely be a grind — especially when it was 90 degrees or more in those booths facing west into the setting sun. It was worse at the “Break-a-Plate” — break, chip or crack any two plates with one 50-cent baseball throw — because of all the dust. There was usually one 20-minute break a day. But once a week a bunch of us would go out for dinner after the park closed to Gregg’s, Gantry’s, Arthur Treachers… those were really fun times.


I met my wife-to-be, Diane, who worked with Mrs. Leake — everybody called her Gram — where you turned in the coupons you had won at Skeeball and other games for amazingly lousy prizes. I didn’t fall in love with her until I learned her Dad, Jack Gould, had actually built the Castle of Terror (sometimes known as the House of Horrors) and the Wildcat. That kinda sealed the deal for this midway maven.


We’ve been blessed with two sons, and were lucky enough to be able to take them to Rocky Point before it closed. Every time and place has a time and place that defines growing up, and for many of us there and then, in post World War II Rhode Island, that place was Rocky Point.'

His assistant’s name was Al. As a child in the 60’s, my grandparents and parents would bring us to Rocky Point once a summer. I remember a ride called The Tea Cups. I also recall the Funhouse and that I was always afraid to ride it. Through the 70’s and 80’s I would visit the park at least once a year and I witnesses many changes including new rides and also a change in the crowd. In my early years at the park it was a family oriented park but as the years progressed, the park became a hang-out for teens. The Friday and saturday night rock concerts didn’t help. I also recall some of the Midway shows including a human Cannonball and also a high wire act. 


At the time I worked at Rocky Point, a bar called Cursy’s was open just outside the exit road. Co-workers and I would gather there after work for a drink and a game of pinball (an old Star Trek machine) or, we would drive over to the old semenary on Warwick Neck Ave. and sit at the stone wall looking over the bay. 


I no longer see any of the people I met during that time but I recall some names. Tim and Bill were entrance booth guards and Rick was the train engineer. The “floater” who made the rounds to all the rides and provided 15 minute breaks to the operators I can remember well. I don’t recall his name but he had greased back black hair and in fact, I saw him many years later working at BJ’s in Coventry at the gasoline booth. I also recall Conrad Ferland. He was the Head Honcho there and I can still picture him driving though the park on a small Moped type motocycle. We all behaved when he was lurking. 


As a parent, I took my 2 children to the park on several occassions prior to its closing. My daughter was always a daredevil... even at a young age and wanted to go on all the rides even though when she stood against the wooden cut-out of the boy who said, “you must be as tall as me to ride”, she didn’t quite meet the requirement. She would stand on her tippy-toes in a desperate attempt to ride the Corkscrew or Sky-Diver. 


After the park sadly closed, we bagan taking our children to The Enchanted Forest in Hopkinton for a few years. I believe that small park in still in operation today. Going there was a sad reminder of the closing of a historical gem... that being Rocky Point Park. It is sadly missed but brings on so many fond memories of days long gone by.'

  content: 'I share alot of memories of RPAP as a visitor as well an 3 year employee of the park from 1989 though 1991.The pay was really crappy no matter how many hours you worked. I was too young at the time to be a ride operator. This saddens me to see the park is gone for good and not even a faint sign of redevelopemnt.


In 1990, after my 16th birthday, I was working the food stand #4 (by the bumper cars) from open to close. I was sent out on my first 45 minute break around 3:30PM that afternoon. I get up to the employee lounge order my lunch and take it out side to enjoy the fresh air and picture perfect day it was. I sit down under the apron when a guy who was a ride op starts talking to me. He mentions to me in our converstion that he heard a rumor a kid who worked in the park rode a bicycle from Providence to the park for work every day. I replied to the guy. “You don’t say?” He said well, that is what they tell me but I’ll tell ya this though, the kid must be in the shape of his life. I chucked under my breath a bit because I was that kid he was refering about. I rode a 10 speed bicycle every year back and forth to work. Was working about 18 - 22 miles a day (pending what year) and I could get to the park faster on the bicycle then a car could taking the highway from Providence. Well, I finished my lunch and go to throw my trash away and walked over to the guy who made the comment about the kid cycling back and forth to work on a bicycle. I looked at him and said, “So what do you think, you think I can keep this shape the rest of my life?” He just stopped dead what he was doing and just looked at me. The guy was stunned because of the fact he thought what he heard was a rumor and nothing more. I still had some time left on my break some 30 minutes or so, so I walked away to lay on the hill and grass just to soak up some sun, listen to the cars drive in, the seaguls crow and the ocean crash on the shoreline. Then it was back to the grind at stand #4. Working with me at the park was never a dull moment. I always made it fun to work with me at the park no matter where I was at.


But in the three years I worked there. This is the most vivid and startling memory I can share with everyone. I was shocked to find out I was the talk for the park for two consecutive years but did not know it. My thrid year I would only ride the bike to work if something was wrong with my car. But as for keep the shape I was in back then the rest of my life. Unfortunately, no I did not. For health reasons I could not ride a bicycle again, even to this day. In June of 1993 I moved out of RI to Ohio, and my family told me the news about the park problems in 96. I denied it until my visit of December 2000.


I just started college and I was on a two week break visiting family and friends. I had gone out with a very good girl-friend of mine dancing for the night. But when I got back home, I was too energenic to sleep. So I asked my baby brother if he wanted to go for a ride. Sure he said. We ended up at Oakland Beach just a stones throw from the old park. It was nearing sun up. And I could not resist. I parked my out of state car just off to the left of the main gate on the lawn. We proceeded to take a final look at the park. I needed closure or something. We walk down the entrance drive and the first gate was open where they let the trucks and delivery vehicles in (by the apalo and stand #1). We walk up the midway slowly bearing right all they up to where the Corkscrew used to be. When I saw it had been burnt down I was about to burst into tears seeing all my memories have been demolished. My baby brother saw I was about to break and craked a joke so I wouldn’t cry. We walked by the train tracks and down to where the Wildcat used to be. I looked over where they used to have concerts and stand #3 (mexican) where all the concerts were held remembering when I met and saw Debbie Gibbson perform my last year there. Then I had to get out of there. All of the memories started overwhelming me. So my baby brother and I headed walked down the rest of park by where the Flume was and exited the park. I’ve never really did get the closeure I was hoping for but it was great seeing her again and knowing although its physical existance was gone Rocky Point Amusement Park would forever live on in those who shared its short lived run.


Yeah, we miss the park. Some of us even wish we could rebuild the park. But all the City/State and SBA care about is the almighty dollar! Values and morals in america don’t exist anymore. This is what brought the park to close. It is ashame when you think about it.'

I really wasn’t  paying attention to how to run and what to shut off or on. I got alot  of people stuck inside, but they would come walking out because it was  nearly impossible to get lost in that structure. The last acts I remember  seeing as I worked was Peter Frampton (his comeback time) and Weird  Al Yankovich. I also worked on the flume. I used to fall asleep on the  second hill when I was supposed to be seperating the logs so they wouldn’t  bang into each other as they went down the last big hill. When I was  about 4 or 5 there was a FunHouse, the opposite of the house of Horrors.  I was always scared to go in the Fun House. As I got older they closed  the fun house and made the bottom into a food court. As I was running  the House of Horrors, there was a 8-track tape that we would play in  a loop all day and night. Well there was also another 8-track tape that  the boss said didn’’t go for the house of horrors. It was the  8-Track tape for the old FunHouse. I don’t remember too many people  who remember the Fun House, but when the final day came and we all parted  our way from the park. I took the ONLY RARE COPY of the 8-Track that  went to the rarely seen funhouse that was there at least in the 60’s  and 70’s (when I remember it). I still have that 8-track, and  made copys of it in the 8-track format and treasured the origanal, which  I still have and still works. I am now 34 going on 35 but that FunHouse  Tape I love and may not be worth much to people who don’t remember  it. Every one knew about the House of Horrors, but this tape is one  of my most treasured pieces that would have been lost or destroyed if  I never took it. I found it behind the 8-track player in the house of  horrors and my boss always said that this wasn’t the tape for  the house of horrors, but another tape from a ride that was once there.  I knew what I had, as soon as I got home I popped it in my old 8-track  player and remember exactly what I remember hearing back when I was  4 or 5. I was always scared of the fun house more than the house of  horrors. But I tell ya, even though I was 21 when the park closed, I  was always scared to walk through the house of horrors. That house of  horrors must have went through at least 4 changes that I can remember  since I was a child. Rocky Point was the biggest part of my childhood  growing up in the 70’s and being born in 71. Fireworks, Clamcakes,  Fries, Chowder, and DoughBoy. My favorate game was always the BB Gun  Range where you had to shoot out the star from the card. I never won,  but it was awesome. And they moved the skyrockets above that game shed.  Anyone remember the rumor about the kids who jumped off the skyliner  where it turned around at the rock cliff? That was a good old story  for a while!!'

I wouldn’t have to be at work till an hour after everyone else because the cyclone was a “major attraction”. We all liked it because it was the only manually run ride in the park and you actually had to have a little skill to run it. Some of my fondest memories and some of my closest friends originated at the park. It wiil be sorely missed.'

They would  get so high and it was in the 80s so girls wore their jelly shoes and  I lost one by accident and it ended up hitting someone. I remember always  closing my eyes on the House of Horror’’s only to find out that  I missed a big fake lady dressed in rags with bubble gum all stuck to  her face. I remember the awful smell inside the House of Horrors but  to this day, I’d pay anything to be able to smell it again. And  who could forget the clam cakes and chowder.

  content: 'My first memory of RP was going to the park while visiting relatives in CT (we lived in ME). My cousin and I had the same frames for our glasses, and when we took them back from our mothers after riding the “log ride”, they had mixed them up!


Later on, as teenagers, my sister, cousin and I went to RP on our own during another visit to CT. This time, we bought some of those exquisite clamcakes to take back home. My cousin set the paper bag of cakes on top of her car while unlocking the door, and a seagull swooped down and grabbed the bag! We were stunned, but Kathy fought that darned bird — and won.


After I met my now husband, originally from Providence, we went to RP once and it rained so bad the rides were shut down. We got our picture taken in one of those booths. I still have the pics. We were soaked, but had a great time. 


By the time our first daughter was born (1997) and we were living in Providence (1998), RP had been closed and was in decline. For Halloween of 1998, the House of Horrors was open just for fun, so we went; mainly for the nostalgia.


Another memory I have of RP was riding the Rock N Roll with my cousin (the seagull fighter) and her dad. The seat belts didn’t work properly on the ride, and I almost fell out. I never went on that ride again.


Now I live in Western Washington. There’s an amusement park here called Wild Waves &amp; Enchanted Village. It used to be independently owned, but sold out to Six Flags a few years ago. The first time we went, I saw this huge red and white roller coaster that looked vaguely familiar. Later on, I found out it was the Corkscrew from RP! The next time we went to Wild Waves, the Corkscrew was painted this ugly green color, and it’s new name is The Wild Thing.

So when we got to  the park I did not want to ride the dreaded “House of Horrors”.  But part of me was still curious. My uncle and dad forced me to confront  my fear and quit being such a chicken. I was Ok for the first 10 seconds  of the ride but terror struck me as the car clicked up the ascent. I  closed my eyes and wanted to hide on the floor of the car. They heckled  me the whole time as the car jerk about through doors and what not. Didn’t see a thing until the car stopped. I might have peeked  once for a split second! I never rode it again.

My father would drive from his work  in Walpole Mass. to RP just to get us the red and white chowders and  the best damn clamcakes in the world. I would ride the cyclone over  and over , the flume we would save for last cause in the front we would  get soaked. My sister used to cry when I would make her ride the house  of horrors with me . In 1995 I moved to Los Angeles , when I found out  they closed RP I must have cried for a week. I never looked at another  amusment park the same again.

The next summer I worked  in the Fudge Kitchen which was across from the carousel. I worked at  the Fudge Kitchen for 5 summers in a row. The first few years I worked  at Rocky Point the crowds were large and business was brisk. My last  few years there the crowds thinned and began to change from mostly families  with kids to teenagers. In an effort to bring in more business the management  sponsored late night raves and Greatful Dead cover bands. It was sad  to witness Rocky Point’s decline. Working at the Fudge Kitchen  with all of my friends (mostly from Warwick Vets) was by far the most  fun I have had at any job. I have such fond memories of Rocky Point.

Then it was off to the dining hall for chowder  and clamcakes then finishing it all off with, if I remember right watermelon.  Next were the rides, my fondest memory had to be my sister and I along  with my grandmother in the Scrambler, we all laughed so hard as she  was trying to keep from “squishing” us as the ride went  from side to side. Now that I look back on it she had to be in her 60’s  when she went on these rides, dang I miss her so much she was the coolest!  Another time my sister and I were on the gondola ride above the minature  golfcourse and we both made the mistake of dropping things on the players  below and when we got back to the landing the attendant wanted to take  us both back to the office but as you can imagine my grandmother would  have no part of that! I went back there once I think about 1997 and  it was closed,very depressing to me to see Rocky Point in the state  i found it because I had not known it had been closed.

(I’m 34 now) Right next  door we were so fortunate to have Rocky Point park. It was the best  anyone could have wanted back in those days… We would fall asleep  to the sounds of the rides and the people and the music and the sounds  of the bats hitting the balls from the batting cages (when it was there).When  I got older, I would walk the path over to the park and get my share  of skee ball and riding the cyclone over and over and over again. I  would ride the Enterprise and the Skydiver and be afraid of the YoYo  ever since one summer it toppled over and was out of commission for  a while. The house of horrors is still one of the scariest rides I can  remember. Those were the times of my life… eating clam cakes on  the dock and getting the coupons for the ride all day bracelets (Almacs  usually had it them)… remember when they were metal clasps with  colored string and kids in the parking lot would beg you for yours when  you left for the day?

About 17 or so years ago, my Aunt and Uncle  bought a cottage at Rocky Beach and we spent many summers sitting in  her yard enjoying the atmosphere that the Park brought us. After spending  our summers at my Aunt and Uncle’s House, my parents then bought  their own cottage at Rocky Beach about 4-5 years ago. This is where  they still spend their summers. We’ve celebrated all of our summer  birthdays and holidays at “the cottage” since there is no  where else we wanted to be. Most of our childhood, teenage, and adult  memories originated from our experiences and celebrations at the Rocky  Point Amusement Park and at the cottages at Rocky Beach. Now…  after so many people cried the day they closed, the land is sold to  high corporate businesses and they are taking it all away from us to  make millions of dollars. I wish they knew how they have broken so many  people’s hearts in doing this… it’s truly a shame  that something like this can happen.'

One time Saint Raymonds school had an outing in the fall. It was raining and most of the rides were shut down for the season. One or 2 classmates figured out how to start the dodge’ems (I never knew they were called “Skooter”). We rode around for FREE for at least a half hour before Sister Cathlene came looking for us. She walked around for awhile before her conscience got the better of her and made us quit. 


I live on the West Coast now and you couldn’t find a Clam Cake with a magnifying glass. The only thing remotely close to those things is an amusement park in Santa Cruz, Ca. It has an old wooden Roller Coaster like Crescent Park.'

I was 3 when we first started to go. In my eyes I was Rocky Point’s favorite little girl that came to visit them. I only thought that way because when I was 4 years old they let me ride the Corkscrew. Well, that is because my mom signed an agreement that if I died on the ride or fell off it wasn’t their fault and she couldn’t sue them and that I always had to ride with an adult. I rode that coaster like there was no tomorrow. I also remember that when I’d ride the Cyclone with family members that they couldn’t stay on as long as I could. That still amuses me to this day. By the time I was either 6 or 7 Rocky Point was having financial problems. We went once when they switched owners and we didn’t stay there for more than 15mins. It was terrible. Then sortly after all that they shut it down. That place was my favorite childhood memory. I don’t care if it was a scuzzy looking place. It was my favorite scuzzy looking place!

I’m 32 now, and to this day, Rocky Point was the coolest job I have ever had! I still walk past people making cotton candy in festivals an such and say, “Hmm. Amateurs! Try getting cotton candy to stick to a cone in 100% humidity!” I vividly remember coming home completly sugar coated after working all day.


I have a few theories on why Rocky Point is no longer. One in particular is the popularity of the television. More and more people were staying home on summer nights. Another reason is security. Toward the end it got worse and worse, with the fights every night and gangs of youth that showed up. This pushed the families away.


Also, Rocky Point also had a huge employee theft problem. Their employees would rip them off, big time! Everything was CASH! I believe they paid the “game of chance” employees next to nothing because they KNEW they would pocket money for themselves.


And finally, the park was simply, and sadly out of date. How could RP compete with places like Six flags. It would’ve taken an enormous amount of money to give the park what it needed and nobody would put up that kind of money for a park located in a residential neighborhood, with no easy highway access. RP just wouldn’t work if it were reopened today.


RP used to bring people from around the world to work the summer. People as far away as Indonesia! (Two smoking hot girls from Scotland come to mind) I miss all of them, and the good times at RP.'

That was the last thing he wanted to do after a day in a sweaty jewelry shop, but he did it anyway. After an exhilerating ride on the Whip, my next stop was the Penny Arcade. The Gypsy grandmother would whir out a fortune card for me; and I would never miss putting my penny in the little machine where you looked into an ornate viewer and turned a little handle which rapidly flipped the many photo cards inside, making an animation happen before your eyes! I’d buy a little cellophane Kewpie doll on a stick, with feathers and sparkles, or a colorful paper parasol. Topping the night off with those fantastic clam cakes, I would go to bed a happy child. If only I could travel int ime, to see those wonderful buildings and rides with new eyes, and appreciate the art form they were.

You knew summer was here when you saw or heard their advertisement.


My entire family would stand in line to get some “cakes and chowder”. I didn’t even like clams in those days but the cakes were too good to resist. I particularly liked throwing the clam cakes from the dock as high into the air as possible and watch the sea gulls gobble them in mid air.


I have many fond memories with family and grandparents and think it’s a shame that future generations won’t get to experience it. 


I live on the west coast now and can only dream of taking my three children there. They would’ve loved it. I keep trying to recreate their clam cakes and chowder in my California kitchen (theres no chowder and cakes here you know) but it certainly doesn’t taste the same.'

  content: 'The park was wiped out in the 38 hurricane and remained dormant for 10 years. It came under the control of Vincent Ferla, among others, and Vincent screwed his partners out of their share. Vincent had two brothers, Corado and John. My Dad owned a bar at 45 Atwells Ave. which he had to sell to his younger brother Pete in 1948 upon the death of their mother. My Dad borrowed $5000 from his sister Lena and brought a ride to the 1948 Rocky Point called the Spitfire (see photo). My Dad’s on the right. The Penny arcade is in the background. It was owned by Louie Mazza from Bridgeport, CT. Louie had a brother Mario who stood about 6’4&quot; — huge gentle giant. These are the original Mario brothers.
  

Anyway, my dad went to the Pokerino one day to change a $20 bill and Jimmy Vogel (Diamond Jim) went with a bushel of bills to change them. At that moment, Dad knew he was in the wrong business with the Spitfire ride. 


He sold the Spitfire and constructed the concrete Skee Ball building at the base of the hill across from the Penney Arcade. Dad went to the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and bought 20 alleys ($2000 per alley) with no credit. The owner told my Dad had an honest face and he could pay him when he could. Skee Ball was 5 cents at the time. He waited for Crescent and Lincoln Parks to go to 10 cents for 1 season, and then raised his price. In doing this, he took their customers. The box that collected dimes was beneath the lever you pulled to release a vertical stop that allowed the 9 balls to come down. This box could hold $500 in dimes. On a good Sunday, the Skee Ball could gross $2000. That’s 20,000 games or 1000 games per machine. That’s about 80 games per hour for 12 hours.


We’d be prepping the stands prior to Memorial Day opening and we’d hear shotgun blasts. A while later, we’d see the 3 Ferla brothers walking down the midway from the merry go round with their shotguns and dinner; pigeons. Those guys would eat almost anything. Their mother lived in the house on the hill above the SkeeBall. John Ferla and his wife Pina lived with her there. John handled all of the park’s maintenance issues. Vincent and his wife Carolyn lived over the Cliff House, a lounge on the cliff overlooking the bay. It also incorporated the park office. Conrad Ferla ran the Shore Dinner Hall.


When minimum wage was $1.25/hr my brother in law and I worked the stand one 3rd of July and lost 72 stuffed animals to winners (our most expensive prize was $36/doz wholesale). We grossed a hair over $1000. That was a great day. But the park business was sometimes the most boring place in the world. imagine, 3pm, Wed, July, 100 deg, no one around in the park, the park music permeating everthing, no one but an 8 year-old kid with one dime. You’ve made 40 cents the previous 2 hours since opening. The kid plays his name, Joe, wins, and makes you climb to the top of the stand where the temp is 125 deg to get a 6 foot stuffed goofy looking snake.


My Dad also owned the Skooter (aka Dogde-em, bumper cars) ride. That was a 2 minute ride for 20 cents. It was the only ride in the park not owned by Vincent Ferla, the park owner. It also was the only ride where you exited the ride and then paid. It was also portable. The walls were collapsible. Almost no one knows that. When Ferla refused to give Dad a 5 year lease on his other 15 concession (Skee Ball, Rocky (bingo for prizes) game, fish pond, hoopla, 3 stuffed animal stands (A1 A2 and A3), Blanket stand, doll stand, lamp stand, knock down the cats, cig/candy, basketball — he brought in a tractor trailer and began ride disassembly 1 week before the official opening. This would have left a wonderful “hole” in the park. Dad got his lease.


I remember once the concessionaires elected NOT to hire the Beatles for a 3-day engagement for $20K because they felt it was too much money.'

It was completed using materials “found” in local construction sites. The locker entrance was constructed by a member to keep uninvited guests out. We would like to thank all the junkies, Providence Police, and RI underworld for the fire, smashing up the ramps and essentially ruining what was a great spot for local skaters and graffiti punks. This place was a great example of what a bunch of high school drop outs and thayer street rats can do with a space most of the well to do in Providence want to destroy.

Artisan shops and boutiques, cafes, a fruit veggie &amp; flower market, a News Stand (there arent and notable news stands I can think of in an area like this) perhaps some late night eatery, Trader Joes, etc. Include perhaps more retail and the second floor then add a mix of low income artist space/loft live-work studio with a mix of some decently priced apartments for those fresh out of college who are mature, but who might not yet have a set career path on the third floor with roof top decks and patios. Anchor it on both ends with a resturant / lounge, both occupying three levels. I should get some credit for this.'

In Europe, they preserve and protect their rich history and pass on their traditions from one generation to the next, but in Rhode Island we have neglected and abandoned what we always claimed to have favored such as the Brewery, the Outlet, Rocky Point, the Shore Dinner Hall, the Warwick Musical Theatre, etc., etc. Of course, the politicians and land developers call this “progress”. All of these places, however, could have been saved if only the younger generation were as proud, aggressive, business savvy and innovative as their ancestors once were. Yes, we need to get our act together and the politicians need to stop catering to the rich and powerful! Replacing our history and traditions with things like Lowes, Condominiums, and fancy strip malls is not a very good thing for the Ocean State. Very soon we will become a state with few hints of history and tradition. '

  content: 'I moved to the Arlington section of Cranston in the spring of 1990 and one of the first things I noticed was the old brewery. When I got to know the kids in the nieghborhood, we’d explore the grounds and while walking the tracks that ran along side the brewery and under Cranston St. you could see a visual time line. Many of the buildings that made up the once thriving factory each had it’s erected date, signifying the difference in time periods. It was really cool to see and ultimetly taken for granted. That summer, we found a way into the old brewery, which was no easy task. We had to litterally climb into an open window that was perched about eight or nine feet from the ground, and once you were up there, you had to wedge your body through the brick interior and the conveyor belt that ran down into a small dark tunnel on your right. On your left you could see a larger opening that lead to a much larger room. It was very creepy (the chipped paint, the smell of mildew etc.) Crates with empty beer bottles still sat on the conveyor belts, Playboy centerfolds lined the locker room walls, all dating back to the mid 60’s to late 70’s. It was pretty cool stuff and yes, taken for granted. You could clearly see when the day came and shut down for good, everybody stopped what they were doing and just left. Very creepy but cool none the less. Ounce you made it up and through and over (you had to crawl down the belt to the larger room on your left) you had countless hours of fun and dangerous exploring to accomplish. Not all of the brewery could be explored however. The old catwalk bridge was securly locked so I never got to see the whole brewery. On the other side of the property ( facing Garfield) me and my friend Josh had a small hangout spot under one of the loading docks. He noticed a vent cover under the loading dock and we decided to take a screw driver to it and after several minutes of hard labor, we got the metal cover off. What we found was the ULTIMATE hangout destination. When your a 13 year old kid, this was better than Rocky Point!!!!!!! We’d go to the NHD ( now abandon!!) on Cranston St. and buy spray paint to decorate the walls inside. Im not to sure the purpose of this room was, it looked like some sort of bomb shelter. It had no windows and was very dark ( even in broad daylight) so a flashlight was always needed. And on the far end (where Gibbs School is located) was this big blue tower that overlooked the whole damn brewery. The view, (and I don’t mean to be cheesey) was breath taking. I really miss that place and looking at the old photo’s really brought me back. It was an amazing building providing so much history and adventure. It was all taken for granted. The fire a few years later only caused security to be beefed up, ending any future fun. I consider myself lucky, but pissed!! I thought that place would be there forever (like Rocky Point) at my disposal.'

One night a fan threw a workboot on the floor to protest a bad call. At that time, the court was oriented north-south and so it was really intimate. That was just as the Civic Center was being built. So Brown would play a couple games a year at the Civic Center but most games at Marvel. I was waterboy for two seasons and really loved it, but the team could never win on the road against Penn and Princeton so never even made NIT. Best player I ever saw there: Brian Taylor of Princeton, who went on to play with the Nets. Saw the Penn coach who coached the Pistons to the NBA titles coach there too.

I believe it was the first downtown department store with central air conditioning, a big attractant for summer shopping. There were massive compressors and huge (asbestos insulated) ducts all over the top floor that chilled air and dropped it to the floors below. 

The next floor down had offices and staff areas that looked very 1950s-60s. The neatest place was the employee check-in area. There were wall hooks where floor workers hung their outdoor coats, a counter with numbered cubicles where they checked their pocketbooks or personal effects, and a changing room where they put on their W.T. Grants uniforms for the work day. It all still had a vague “ready for work tomorrow” look to it.'

Later it got a new facade and became the oft-avoided Traveller’s Aid place, and Strawberry’s Records, and, a smaller record shop called Rainbow Records. Outside the Dunkin Donuts an innocuous stone/concrete planter was known later on the street, according to the news, as the infamous “the island”. It was a hangout for genuinely creepy types sometimes, and profiled as the “starting point” for those now-jailed hoodlums who infamously robbed/carjacked/shot a young couple using an ATM. I’m not sure if it was taken out by the city (last time I drove by it) just to get rid of it’s association. More has been torn down since, the entire corner of buildings as I remember, is gone.'

Chace and associates control the Smith, Alice, Burgess, Burgess Heirs, O’Gorman and Wilkinson buildings, plus the Peerless/Low buildings. with all their apartments, condos, office and retail spaces. The garage is plainly meant to accomodate these interests. Easing the city’s parking restrictions would help some of these new residents find parking for their cars.

The ProJo article calls this “an effort to reinvent what used to be the city’s downtown shopping district.” It concerns me that so much of downtown Providence is in the hands of just a few players with the same plan in mind.

Out goes the Dunkin Donuts, a bar, a popular live performance venue, a social services agency, and two small “specialty’ stores, to be replaced by – what? Oh, “conveniences such as a florist or dry cleaner and a specialty store with a Providence flavor ”. Great.

Nobody who ever passed Travelers Aid on a warm day, when the smell of stale piss came off the street and sidewalks, will truthfully regret that it’s moved elsewhere; but “ridding” the city of troublesome types and the places they frequent reflects a suburban, gated-community approach to urban planning.'

But what they want to put there is a open parking lot, in an already very dense area, around the corner from where the city bus station and several underground parking garages are. And this is just for that square mile area! I’d say we were over adaquetly supplied in that area? Time to divert more attention into renovating old station houses, building new ones, making new bus routes, encouraging more walking, otherwise small seemingly insignifigant buildings such as this will be used to henpeck the city little by little into a giant car yard for Boston, where pedestrians are stopped every 15 feet to wait for a lot patrons to exit. (Which is what I must say, the area around Waterplace Park looks and operates exactly like). People have put up with this too often in other cities, time to make it stop – Put up a Fight!'

My family (going back 3 generations) lived there, too, until the last of us moved out in the mid 1980s. I have heard many stories from relatives that when they were growing up – they used to play in the complex (disaster waiting to happen). After seeing a mill fire up the other end of Valley Street as a kid, I constantly used to worry that this mill would catch fire, and we would lose our house. Judging by the pictures and the conditions of the mill (and the many mill fires I have seen since), I dont think my fears were off base… While I am all for preservation of these types of buildings (similar to the work done at both ends of Valley Street) I think there was only so much at that time that could be done, and really, in the end, this was a win-win for the neighborhood. As the visual aspects of the neighborhood look so much better. However, for personal reasons, I am glad they chose to save the Uncas Building (My grandmother, and other relatives worked there for many years). When I drive by, I can still see them (from when I was a kid) waving their hankees/white towels in the window at me, towards our house, as our living room windows faced where they all sat. It was a big thrill as a kid. After my grandmother passed away a few years ago, I drove down Newark street – when I got to the corner of Valley street, and I looked up at the top floor of Uncas – I saw that same sight (although I realized a few minutes later, it was just workmen) and for just those few seconds, I saw Grandma.'

After the year and a half of teaching, I moved to Boston when I graduated from RISD and lost touch with the Reverend and the students. If anyone recalls this class and wants to get in touch with me, please do. My first group consisted of six boys, ages 10-13. Two were Alter Boys, Steven Grant and Teddy Wilcox (who I am in touch with today). Also in the photography groups were Ronnie Nance, Michael and Steven Goode, Steven and Norman Baxter. Our groups met at the adjoining Church House in a large room naturally lit by enormous arched windows. In the summer, I moved into a room in the house next door to the church and taught art in their youth program. I recall many of those young girls and boys &mdash; Patty Person and Shirla, Richie Taylor, John Sousa, and Tommy Smith. In total, I have the names of 52 wonderful children who I met during my year teaching and would love to hear from any one of them if they read this note.'

  content: 'Agreed. This proposed building is bland-o-rama. The composite photo (of the Mercantile Block with Hotel on top), looks a little more interesting though and would at least provide a space for the Cuban Revolution and New Japan to stay at. I think that providing accomadations for established businesses is particularly important as most were there when times weren’t good. They provided the good food, entertainment, and services that helped back up the city’s “Providence Renaissance” campaign in the 90s when people were looking for more evidence of it beyond the hype of the new mall and relocated rivers, as good as they have been. What would be the motivator of an established business to stay or a new business to stay long term if there was always an easy threat of displacement? Why not just take up residence in Cranston, Warwick, Johnston, where that threat would not be easily realized?'

description: 'HABS RI-408, submitted 1998 — This district is comprised of 11 buildings on Kinsley and Harris Avenues and Terminal Way constructed between 1894 and 1947. The buildings are associated with local food storage, processing, and distribution. All of the major warehouses were connected via a spur line to the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad. A series of underground tunnels connected Merchant’s and neighboring distributors who depended on the warehouse for their cold storage.'

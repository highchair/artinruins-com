description: 'National Register 82000135, submitted 1982 — A compact, nineteenth-century industrial area located just west of downtown Pawtucket includes four mills on four city blocks. While alterations have been made on several of the buildings, the changes are consistent with their use as manufacturing sites. Church Hill retains the fabric and scale of a nineteenth-century manufacturing district.

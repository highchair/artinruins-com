description: 'In 2011, an elevated portion of Interstate 195 cutting through Providence was relocated, freeing <a href="//www.195district.com/about/district-land/" target="_blank">over 26 acres of former highway land</a> for redevelopment. The quasi-public I-195 Redevelopment District and its oversight Commission were created to oversee the sale, marketing, and redevelopment of this land.'

==========

Locally generated static HTML site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with 
[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-autoprefixer).


## Get started with Bundler

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Serve the site locally

Includes a site HTML compile and SASS compile. Use the `incremental` flag to build 
only the assets that have changed. The `JEKYLL_ENV` variable is assumed to be 
"development" when omitted. 

```bash
$ jekyll serve --I
```

Builds into the Stage folder: `_stage`.

In a browser, open [http://127.0.0.1:4090/](http://127.0.0.1:4090/)

### Additional Flags

+ `--drafts` to publish/preview drafts
+ `--future` to publish/preview posts with a future date
+ `--unpublished` to publish/preview posts marked with unpublished


## Build the Site for Production

Specify the production environment to omit content intended for development only. 
Optionally, add the future flag to publish posts that have a future timestamp. 

```bash
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build --config _config_prod.yml --I --future
```

Builds into the Production folder: `_prod`. Used so that we may conduct incremental 
builds and only upload what has changed. Will conditionally include the Google
Analytics tag in production build mode. 


## Taxonomy pages

Taxonomies like neighborhoods, towns, designers, years built, etcâ€¦ are actually 
just pages with extra Front Matter. Liquid queries get the properties associated 
with those bits of Front Matter.

Example: 
```
# In _includes/project-category-loop.html
{%- assign items = site.property | where: page.type, page.category | sort: "title" -%}
```

For a "Date Added" page where `type: date-added` and `category: '2002'`, 
`items` will be an array of Properties where `date-added` == `2002`.
